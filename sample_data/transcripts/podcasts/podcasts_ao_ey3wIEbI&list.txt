where does twists even fit between all of these categories because he can he can entry he can close rounds he's very like a master of everything in that way it does make sense that he would want to be an igl but but I still would just prefer to to have him as he was and not like temper or something that's that's great you know are you tired of your boring old skins head to trade it and trade them

ones what was the one with that guy Aila what did he do no that's W World wcg w wcg the world cyber games not world what were they called Jesus Christ the E frag tournament this is the Chinese one this I think they paid I think they paid everything oh def frag was TWC TWC this is true the world championship I think it was I got my acronyms [ __ ] up the I think the argentinians never got paid for that which is crazy e was actually my first job in Esports I was a moderator no I never got paid I was a moderator on the twitch I actually also worked at deag but I I actually got paid so racist racist one of the few not it wasn't easy I'm not saying it was easy to get paid but I got paid the 50 or whatever per month that uh that they made but no I'm uh repping the real um Esports World Cup you know that's that's my that's my shirt for the day wa it should say iesf then shouldn't it yeah that's also under Saudi Arabia now so which apparently is still different not I I thought it wasn yeah but a different tournament and they're going on almost a similar times I don't understand I mean the qualifier is now but the in November something okay uh look before we get into all that Prof you were on holidays you join us for last week's episode what are you getting up to anything exciting I enjoyed the going into the YouTube comments of last week's show and seeing like I hope Prof recovers I'm like what the [ __ ] are they talking about and like okay okay let's see uh what kind of Lies were said about me and then it was the thing about anal Fishers I was like ah wasn't lies after all so it's tough you know it is because and now especially with the amount of time we all spend on the toilet on our phones I'm sure a lot of people uh are experiencing anal fishes if not hemorrhoids I don't know which one's worse uh but just make sure you don't confuse it with blood and your stool guys you know you want to make sure that you understand where the blood is coming from but it's great that you've recovered you're looking as healthy as ever I enjoyed um paying attention to Counter Strike it was it was really nice like I expected to come back to so many things like oh my God this guy went over here like my inbox exploding oh Prof how do we do this but it was like act I mean there was a lot of messages but nothing really important nothing really important happened I feel like not not that nothing happened but you know everything kind of as we expected nothing really crazy out of the ordinary with all the roster changes that happened so I I feel pretty mean apart from snacks I guess for you yeah we didn't know about that for a while but we we expected something to happen we just didn't know what who was going to replace oie right well this has just put a whole different spin on the anal fishes uh because Lord Richie and chat said not going to lie with sponges accident sound like he was saying anal fishes now you could be into some real kinky [ __ ] with that anal fishes yeah oh fishes it's like the like the Geral from uh South Park but a little bit more aquatic I guess uh okay look let's get into after all yeah well it's heating up outside and in here under the collar all right let's get into it there's no I don't think we need the bumper do we Lucas roll the bumper [Music] anyway Prof how many minutes do you need to talk about G2 or not need no need how many do you need zero okay well I'm going to give give you more I'll give you more two minutes about G2 okay hold on I'm setting the bar before you start because you weren't here so we didn't get your thoughts on it uh I will be starting a timer get it out on my phone and then uh before you before you say anything I just also was in the comments for for the last episode you know how we never talk about G2 um we never talk about G2 we never talk about G2 and then we made this like special episode you guys made it I would I was not involved um then the comments were like what what is this obsession with G2 I'm like how is this you can never it can never be never I also saw I also saw an hltv comment that said like something like Striker can't wait for his to talk about his brothers in G2 I'm like where did that come from exactly you have a sh in your name you are yeah I guess I'm buan now yeah okay are you ready all right and just so can see here we have the 2 minutes on the screen and the time starts now so honestly my my instinctual uh take or feeling about this snacks move is good I have to say it's good I don't know I know that facts and looking into things a bit bit better uh looking at the roles doesn't really make any sense but just thinking of snacks if you think of snacks as snacks not like gamer Legion snacks but like the snacks that you know and love from 25 years ago it kind of makes sense to have him in like lurky and anchor positions like you can see that happen and somehow I just feel there will be some magical connection this is me just off the top of uh being on the beach every day in the Sun and vibing and being like full Positive Vibes this is how I feel about in like 40° heat for a week on my dad yeah mental you know mental exhaustion mental deprivation of water and brain uh but this is this is how I feel and I know it doesn't make sense but I have a good feeling about it sometimes it doesn't have to make sense yeah sometimes it just it just has to be know you you you all were probably pretty negative I saw I went through the like Community reacts which used used that article very greatly because I was on Twitter to see like what have people said and most people were you know we critical which I understand I don't think we were critical well maybe confused flabbergasted even I don't feature in those articles because I don't tweet anything after roster change has happened because I'm on 700 different podcasts that I might as well [ __ ] talk about it in long form and I think I was more akin to agreeing with Pit's tweet which is about them doing good in the short term but probably tapering out and not doing good in the long term um I mean I also think the the the snacks Taz combo is kind of weird you know that's that's uh that's an interesting one I would have again would have liked someone with more recent coaching experience for this team that's kind of my my Pro problem that's something are you pointing at yourself that's the time is it coming through yeah y okay nice but uh I I took some of your time and S of Striker so you can have an extra 30 seconds no that's uh that's kind of it that's from the top of my head we'll I guess we'll talk about it through the the preview and everything else I'm I'm excited it's exciting you can't say it's not exciting you can't say that there's not potential there they're cooking with something but maybe there's you know too much spice in this it was just it was just mild you know it wasn't like a spicy vindaloo it was just it was a butter chicken but everybody loves butter chicken you know chicken can be spicy you know depends on who you ask that's true yeah okay all right uh let's jump into I guess liquid's roster um I had Striker messaged me like every couple of days is it jks I know it's not this guy is it the last time he he asked me I just sent him a selfie I just sent him a picture uh Striker Striker said is it is it jks and I sent him this that's what I sent him I just said that you look so round there I I guess it's the angle of which I took the photo but also I I trimmed the the neck B bit which helped with the framing of the face so I just sent him that photo uh you just outed yourself as a my potential Source but at that moment I sitting one seat away from me well actually a slight void because he was at dinner with his parents-in-law I I was sitting next to twists so you know if that photo was slightly wider it would have it would have shown a lot more information you know but how was uh how was the wedding it was beautiful it was it was it was very very magical uh no it was a very beautiful venue they had it in and everything was great so um yeah it was a good evening congratulations to Russell and the miss van vulin yeah yeah so that was you know I got to sit next to raban at dinner which was nice you know so I had a good time uh but yeah the the roster for liquid is still rumored to be as it's not official from liquid yet but I believe that the source is citing the blast roster for their group stages coming up in a couple weeks time uh it is obviously Naf twists and yakinda existing from the core of the old team minus skulls minus Zeus minus Kaden plus ultimate the Polish Ora he's about 20 years of age and uh jks as well as Mitha as the coach so that's the the new liquid roster shock and a gentlemen uh I've known about this for a while but what are your what are your opinions on this how we feeling about it I was getting a bit worried that JZ was seen as this poisoned Apple after his time with G2 and I heard that I heard that behind the scenes a lot where like people were kind of skeptical about getting jks on their teams and that was from like multiple angles and I was a bit surprised by that just because of especially how much of a obvious fit he was into all the positions that that liqu would need him for and just you know you heard these names like nerds instead of him and obviously that would have been like more exciting a bigger like a bigger star or whatever at this point and more future in that perhaps but you know it would have taken a lot more changes in the team to actually make it work and then you get into like this G2 discussion again where it's like you know how how are they going to make it work where everybody will get what they want and so Jak is just I don't know on the face of it it just looks like an a completely obvious move at least that's where we can start yeah I mean we we spoke about it on the show we like throwing some names around for for liquid um in this role and it it made sense you know he's a he's a guy that's proven in the anchor role and that has that is free or or freeish from all that we know right so it was it's a good move in my opinion he's also a native English speaker worked on International Teams different teams uh you know there's nothing to imply that he's going to be uh kind of like skulls I would say where you had you had promise and potential but not really proven on the on the top top level had very few teams and everything so you didn't really know what what you're getting I think in because you really you know what you're getting there's no real uh question mark I think in terms of what you're getting from jks I think the bigger question mark is obviously in the in the oping oping and who is Elling these are the two things that honestly considering how big changes and risks there are I would say it makes sense to also go for someone in the in the anchy role that is more known and stable yeah I I think just to Circle back on a couple of things in being a name that's thrown around quesado is one that we saw in the headlines obviously we're going to talk about him resigning with Fury in a little bit of time but the key reasons for that and and this is something that Jason would always be preaching to me and I would always be pushing back because if I was liquid at this point I think they're going to fall under the same category as a G2 or a phase which is just going to be these te this roster that houses big names and tries to play a looser not more individual style of Counterstrike because if you look at the way that they play obviously individuals is what drives them through with the moments but they are playing Team based CS right there is there is um rhyme to their reason or Reason to their rhyme is probably what I should be saying but the jks or the nerds or the kado essentially would f a position within that team that would keep them being North American which as far as I'm aware only is going to matter for the next major anyway but well actually no it would still matter for future Majors right because invites to the event will probably still be Regional to some degree I'm speculating because we don't know I think I think that's that's a pretty reasonable assumption because like that's been valve's position for long time that they want some some form of a a split representation across regions even though it is marriage based you know it is based on previous major I would say that that will remain to some degree you know yeah so that's uh and it's something that Jason would always be talking about and I assume that the reason that he talks about that from the angle is not just because he's American and wants liquid to remain American is probably because of his history there with the or as well as likely conversations with the manager Steve or maybe nasgul right so I'm sure that he has that he pushes that not because he necessarily just thinks it for no reason right he thinks that's exactly what the org wants based on some good information I'd assume um it is like while we're on that subject though yeah while we're on that subject though I'm not so sure that that's actually the best move maybe it's going to be better now because they actually gained what was it two more spots or one more spot I don't remember now for the next major but last time it was basically you got two losses and you were out and we saw how they lost the fury and complexity and they're out like you can make an argument that it's actually in some ways much more punishing to play in the America's RMR than it is in in Europe because you just have especially when we had the last gen qualifier we're not going to have that now I think uh because of the fewer spots right but still it feels like especially if you want to have a competitive roster I mean you kind of have to expect to be able to qualify from Europe regardless like if you can qualify from 32 European teams as the top 16 not even you don't even have to go deep at a tournament or anything like that you just have to be better than half of the teams there which is realistically you know not crazy it's not insane it's not some massive like obviously it's the competition is much higher in Europe but realistically getting to the major is not so difficult for a team that's meant to have aspirations for titles you know they they will beat three teams three other teams that are going to be in playing in the European armr unless they get some wild seaing problems which is not going to happen anymore you know as long as you have something like a starting off point you know where you have a seating that actually uh is based on some results you know which didn't happen to them last time then you should be fine you shouldn't get some crazy routes to the major that's going to be impossible just because you got matched up against phas then Vitality than na'vi or something you know so I just feel that that's a bit of an overrated angle at this point um regardless of how the organization actually feels you know maybe it is important for them to still be in some sense American just so that you know they retain some of the fan base or they still keep a stay as the biggest name in North America even though they don't actually have the core anymore maybe there's some value in that for them but I'm just saying from the competitive perspective it doesn't to me honestly not anymore yeah fair enough I would always push back on that anyway because I consider a team like liquid to be a world competitor which in my mind you should be competing where everyone is competing right exactly I think honestly it worked as a disservice honestly to the to the previous team considering how much they needed to travel back and forth from Europe to North America to play qualifiers yeah it it just takes away it's time that you could spend you know playing a longer and tougher qualifier in Europe I feel it's going to give you more than flying between continents it's just a pain in the ass realistically and take so much out of the team so um I I don't think it's that important anymore kind of kind of on the on the striker boat obviously the worse you are the more it matters because then then you kind of roll the dice you play less games therefore higher variants you know that that you're going to go through but the better you are you want to play more games and that's kind of what all the big teams are always fighting for you know the Swiss systems double triple quadruple elimination uh formats where they can [ __ ] up and and stay alive because in the long run they know they're going to end up on top all right now uh now we've we've uh covered that off I guess we can focus in a bit more about the two key components that you're talking about here Prof now ultimate uh he's obviously not very well known I would see threads every couple of days from people uh talking about oras and his name literally never came up until it started to get leaked right until yeah the murmurs were coming out and then people were like who the [ __ ] is this guy in their best Conor McGregor impression um so it's it's somebody who's not on the radar of the general populace at all um he's a 20-year- old kid he played for AO that had a Milky and a f winner in a pro league season Once Upon a Time and then 21 2021 I think or 22 Maybe I remember I remember him playing I remember commentating uh some of their games actually but other than that for people it's not really a name that means anything um and then a lot of this also comes with critique of the management right so people see this move and the first thing they do is go well the manager should be fired with this team right and I think think that people uh need to consider is there is definitely input from I would say a lot of input from the players uh on who they're going to get right I I would say that twist did an awful lot of scouting especially so with him picking up the in-game leadership role now would I say that ultimate would have been their first choice no but something that other people probably need to consider is players who are free agents buyout if you're going to spend a certain amount of money for this player right because he's benched on a team but I can get this kid who's mechanically looking very good and we could potentially mold him into something we need versus we pay this much money for a guy who maybe has already showed his ceiling has shown his problems is that outlay of money worth that to just sign this kid for a short period of time see what happens maybe end of the year the Market's wide open and you can buy someone else like some people talking like Hades Senay like these names that people are throwing around imagine trying to buy some P from [ __ ] Falcons yeah like what guys you if you want to take a massive risk then simple you know like yeah good luck throwing around Millions for a guy who hasn't played in in a team for a year you know it's just it it does become kind of crazy but I think what happens with this roster is yeah jks was free because he was a free agent ultimate was he on a luminar or something he was an illuminar but realistically not expecting a massive buy out there exactly so they they're getting both of these players for cheap but one of the conversation points around liquid has kind of been this cycle that they've been in and unfortunately that cycle is going to follow them into this new roster as well we saw the team with paty and Rain Waker there was a lot of flack about the rain Waker pickup it didn't work out right um that gave the py did any better to be honest and where py now yeah right and I think that kind of like sent them down this path and then in hindsight this current roster we look at or sorry the previous roster we look at and we go oh that was [ __ ] but at the time when it came together we didn't think it was going to be [ __ ] we're like okay you know like Zeus the co great we think Kaden okay awesome some personalities who were fired was super high up at the time where it was picked up by liquid like I think everybody thought that this had like title winning potential yeah and and it it turned out to be horrible so like actually if you look at their results they weren't as it as it went to the end I think before it came to like Chang Du and pro league I think that would have been pretty miserable but after the whole thing it's obviously it's not what they would have wanted but at least they made a a bunch of playoffs towards the end that's you know kind of salvaged the their their reputation at little bit at least but twists deciding uh what is he 24 years of age I think to be the in-game leader this is something which he has chosen to take on as far as I understand it's not saying that he's he's been thrust into um and if it's saying that he wants to give a crack obviously there's people who are concerned about it or either you concerned about it do you think this is going to be one of those situations where star player goes to in-game Leading and everything everything falls apart uh I am I'm not I would rather not see him undertake this at least not right now um is I think I think he's just great as he is you know that's that's how I feel about a lot of players I think Nico as well is like you get a player to this level where you would put him in almost any team in the world um why why change right because change will can he be better like how how can he be better than what he was already I think that's just uh it's unreasonable to to expect him to be the same as he was plus igl like there has to be a give and take from from somewhere in his game so we will lose a part of of twist that that we had that was that was amazing that's how I see it and that's how most likely historically things have been it's not like we're just pulling this out of our ass when people are like oh you know a secondary oper picking up the up and being like I'm gonna up this usually does not work this like nine out of ten times does not people don't stick with it and kind of lling what happens it's not like people never stick to lling I think he he can stick but he is an amazing player as as just a player as a rifler as someone that can be pretty versatile and help in in different facets of the game and even looking back U the year that phas was Team of the Year and we were doing like the hltv awards it was where does twists even fit between all these categories because he can he can entry he can close rounds he's very like a master of everything in that way it does make sense that he would want to be an igl but but I still would just prefer to to have him as he was and not like tamper with something that's that's great you know yeah I do think that just because of how the how the qu was set up up until this point I mean I by the way I agree with the concern for sure because this is a guy who also delivers against the best teams consistently like it's not just a guy who will be your start like who will hit Peaks he just has a very high consistent level regardless of the opposition and so this is a guy you can rely on at every single point and I don't know if you can say that for the the roster moving forward and I mean of course Naf has that as well aspect to him but he's not in Star positions he's not going to be changing the courses of games most of the time he's just not he's not going to be the start of the team anymore with how it's set up at the moment and so are you going to be too reliant on Ultimate for him you know to open up space because he's quite aggressive on tside from what I've seen so far I'm kind of looking into him a little bit more and talking to people about him to have some testimonies and just get like an article together to to tell people who he is and what his style is and and just to get a little bit more rest your honor yeah exactly about nothing like that it's more about really about just trying to show people who he is because nobody really knows anything about him right uh but what I was going to get to was the thing that will help twist is because how liquid was set up up until now was having an oper igl right right and so twist was already in a lot of the positions that igls would put themselves into because they are very active they're always going to be in the pack sometimes they're going to be up first but sometimes they're going to be more more of the support development but twist is not going to be a hookie type in game leader who's just going to run in first everywhere and and like jump Corners that's going to be a kindar in this team and so you already have that in your team and as long as you have something like that where you don't have to where you don't have that pressure of entering every site on t-s side and like being the the space taker all the time I think that obviously will help with his output because I mean yeah that's that's just a lot of uh um like jumping corners and all that stuff that that he suddenly doesn't have to concern himself with so he can just look more at the big picture and still stay in somewhat of a star position to to have that same output of course like the something that people maybe don't take into consideration so much is once you go into in game leadership is how much time you have to spend on that as opposed to on your individual level you outside the Ser of course yeah just prep game plan creation all that stuff a lot of the time I'm sure twist already was doing that because he was one of the more active pieces on every single roster he was part of I'm sure even in FaZe you know he he had a decent amount of input but this is another level of that he just has to be the guy who's responsible that at all times and especially with mither coming in I don't know if I see him as this massive Authority or or like this guy who has such high knowledge that he will be always responsible for that himself and twist is going to be more um uh like a co-pilot or whatever so from that perspective I'm just a bit concerned how the game plan creation is going to work how much that's going to tank his individual level just because he's not going to be able to spend so much time on it I I definitely think it's going to be the team playing the way twists wants to play yeah that's for sure and I think based off of his time with carrian he knows how he wants the team to function um so I think that that will be a big blueprint obviously you need to play to the pieces that you have available within your team that is going to be a key component of this but a lot of the concern will mainly be on the T side of how this team is going to function as opposed to the CT side I think with the CT side they're going to have strong pieces across the board I don't I don't think they should have too many issues on the CT side whatsoever ultimate being the question mark of course uh but having strong anchors of Naf and jks the bigger question regarding now for jks is which is going to be the active lur right which is going to be the player because you're going to have your pack which on a lot of maps like a mirage for example is going to consist of your twists your y Kinders and your ultimates taking the mid control but it's on those extremities of having to make those plays is it going to be NAFA is it going to be jks who has to be more active because somebody has to make a play right somebody has to get the use the information that the team is getting to make that play and that can't be a a waypoint type decision it can't be a hey twist can I make that play now and both of them can't be [ __ ] somebody actually has to go for whether it works or it doesn't work you need to be able to make those timings so one of the two of them is going to have to make that adjustment within their game um and you think what if you have to guess who which one would it be well I'm not going to answer that question because I know the answer so and I don't want look I don't want to tell the world how they're going to play they haven't even pred yet so okay my my view of it is nap is probably going to be the one who's going to be taking steps back to to accommodate everybody as he has always been I mean even always been like that for a while now for a while now he has been doing that and he's always been a very verse style player so I would imagine he would take a step back to to allow for jks to have more of his more of his preferred roles whichever does whichever part that means who has which preferred roles between these anymore because like jks also had they had a bit of like aggression in him in in recent times um All Phase stand and stin changed them I feel like and then Naf also in certain times was a bit more aggressive so I think it's more about Vibes then either of them can't do it and and this is like the whole just reading comments uh about let's say the G2 situation and some other teams like ah why are people saying that these These are pro players they can play any role like this is it's such a simplistic View and also just one that has proven time and time again to not be true like there are players that can play different roles and there are players that adapt and there's you know people change positions from tournament to tournament and it's not the end of the world but generally you don't really see a player go from like full on biter to be an O opening entry player that this does not happen and when it happens usually it's like getting some Talent from a tier two tier three team putting him into like roles that he's not played before what happens they play like [ __ ] so we have seen that roles do matter but I I think in the Naf and jks situation both have enough versatility to play either of these you know lurky roles like they both fit in in that I don't think that's uh I don't think there's going to be any point of contention in that for sure yeah I think that a lot of Counter-Strike at the moment though is taking the timings with the information you get and that's the one problem that we don't get the Insight in is when a match is live we get to see all the information we don't actually know what's being communicated right so for players to make the timings I think a very good player to look at who's great at taking timings is somebody like nerds but the biggest issue with that is the timing that you think you have based off the information that you've been given may not always be true right like you're making a mental picture of what you think that the defense is shaping up to look like or even the attack what around they're trying to put together and you make a calculated call or what you think is and you walk out and there's still a [ __ ] holding that angle and you die and it's like well [ __ ] right so but that is a if I don't know if any of you watched but the Maui snake interview with with Stewie and as as crazy as that whole interview was there's one moment when they talk about Nexa and like a situation where Nexa dies like in pit watching short uh and someone just comes along and kills them and they lose like a 2v5 or some [ __ ] I I don't remember on Inferno um and Ste just says like someone called both are short so you know from our perspective Nexa looks like a complete bot in this situation and of course he had some other rounds where you know most likely it was his fault and then you add something that is completely not his fault because he's trusting his teammate and what he's calling which you probably should do if you're in a team uh and then you then everyone's like look at this guy he doesn't know what he's doing he's dying like an idiot you know obviously he could be there but yeah there's there's so much that that's missing and also you don't really know sound how it we know how Sound Works but you know you you're not sure who heard what and they're reacting based off of that or not so from a from a viewer perspective it's very hard to know and a lot of this tilt that people talk about with players most of that tilt gets sacrificed in communication right because a player will then be more like they'll they'll go more inward so when comms are good and things are flowing in a team and things are working nicely that's when the information is perfect right like a guy's calling what he's heard like which sounds basic right but like to the detail right not I think you never hear I thinks it's just things and then people are always offering because they're like things are such a well oiled machine at that point but when people are starting to regress and be a little bit more emo the coms are probably the first thing that start to go down a little bit and especially in pressure games where things are hectic it's also also quite hard to filter that so yeah look um I don't know how we even got to this but yeah I don't know we we we went on a little bit digress we digress uh but talking about ultimate um I just wanted to to ask Striker from your your knowledge so far of this guy can you give us like a oneliner what what type of an oper is he I mean he what I was told by I think this was Mel from his their time together on N this was like the Israeli kind of majority team that ultimate played in for like I don't know four months maybe a year ago uh maybe at the end of last year I think it was um he said he's more aggressive on on TS side than CT um that that would be like one one point and from I was looking through stats that seemed to be the case he seems to be taking the initiative I haven't looked into demos yet because I'm still waiting for I was talking to foron and I'm just waiting for him to answer some questions I had about ultimate before I dive more deeper into his play style um I have a little funny tidbit from Pasha though he was in the Pasha gaming Camp ultimate was and this was around 21 I think and that was that was the time when smoa wasn't fanatic and apparently when smya got kicked and the News came out Pasha went to K and went to ftic and offered him ultimate as the oper for for a replacement for smya apparently he kind of like fnatic never really I mean fnatic never really bit onto that never really actually looked into him but just like a little little snippet where where posha already was thinking about this guy you know potentially making a t a step to tier one three years ago already or whatever it is maybe three four years ago now so U yeah that's that's what I've gathered so far it it is it is going to be interesting with these younger names right because we don't have the we play Academy League anymore which for a few years there was where we saw the names get an option to play against comparable opponents right but now it's like liquid have taken a punt on this guy who is like we mentioned very young and very unknown and it's like oh who the [ __ ] is this how are they going to get you know noticed I guess you you have to have to be looking yeah I mean you kind of grind through the ccts and the online online tournaments and everything realistically looking at is he didn't play that much that's the biggest downside obviously but if you look at this this year he has uh 17 maps against top 50 like 111 rating he played against some decent teams at recent times like bait gamer Legion sampy 3D Max like eyeb Ballers these are all teams he played recently and like posted pretty good ratings like I I'm going to admit I have not he's not been on radar at all um but looking at just his this year there's looks pretty okay like it's not I thought it was much worse honestly because I was like who the [ __ ] is this guy but looking into it a bit there is some promise obviously he is also joining liquid which is a completely different level of play and expectation and pressure and teammates and not just like you know individual moves but how you communicate how you play Man advantage or disadvantage situation so there going to be a huge step up for for him and see if he can if he can live up to it I'm really curious to to see because as you said there must have been something they they spotted in this guy that they that they liked obviously also liquid liquid scouting has sometime been uh pretty hit hit or miss rain Waker doesn't help the category does it yeah so there's a bit of uh I think reasonable skepticism about guy um but ultimately hey pun not intended at all he's a low low risk I would say as as you said there's you play out the season and then by Christmas who knows maybe someone else is off for grabs and if not if this guy proves to be good then you know you got a diamond in the rough that you can work with yeah I mean realistically I mean especially looking at the options I think Chad you were talking about it earlier about some of the other names not necessarily being the the cheapest and also um like if you look at Hades Hades for example that was probably the only real cheap option from like more proven names that they would have gone after and of course I mean that would have been possible but it seems especially from the aggressive angle it seems twist wanted somebody who's more uh who's taking more initiative than Hades was because Hades was was more passive I would say so I'm curious if that came down to to a stylistic difference and if for some reason maybe twist is is going to be taking a little bit of a step back because of his ingame leadership and in terms of initiative he's taking for for entering as I said before like obviously the main part of that is going to be on on Yar but like more finding openings in that's that's more an oper uh oper thing anyway um kind of like finding creative angles and and getting set up for it and stuff like that so I'm curious if that's part of the reasoning obviously you know that's um like Hades probably would have been kind of a safe bet especially with how he's been performing in CS2 but then again I feel like maybe he was a little bit overrated Hades just because of he's got decent stats but when you look at him when he's performing against the top teams it definitely there's a definitely drop and that happens to almost everybody but it is more noticeable with him I would say so maybe that's also a part of it you know and like this is kind of old news now but there was problem with confidence there historically so I'm curious if that's like all these factors could be something that they were taking into consideration I like I for me when I look at this and I see the community uh sentiment I don't understand why it has to be like so negative out of the gate because what if he is good obviously it's more likely that he won't be good but what what if he is good right and also it doesn't help it doesn't help to [ __ ] on this before it even happens yeah if they play a couple of tournaments and he looks out of the water it's like well yeah this guy is no good and then you guys can be like yeah we were right but what's the what is the point of being so negative about before it even happens I don't get it it's hash Vibes and people people just like to be negative but at the same time I understand it more when it's like a a roster change like X for y you know and then you go and directly compare players um but in this case it was it's a bit more complicated situation than oh we wanted a new oper we are replacing you know Hades for senp and then if syp [ __ ] is there a reason to be like why' you do this this is this so stupid but a more yeah convoluted situation yeah and I mean another like another option that would have been there was like warro who just got benched which kind of came out of nowhere I didn't really expect that because as far as I know he doesn't actually have a spot yet anywhere else so I wonder what that's about uh if that's just a difference like if he decided to to to leave Monte at that point or what happen there uh but you know considering the situation with Ukrainian he like at any point he could just be prevented from crossing the border yeah and that's a massive risk to take and especially like if that would be your like one plus one for one you know like if you want him to actually be an ight Gil and you put all the eggs in that basket that's that is a hell of a risk to take yeah so from that aspect like that's another let's say now obvious option you know that maybe doesn't isn't so obvious when you look a little bit deeper into it so and also yeah that would have taken away their America's armr spot so that's that's another Factor but same type of consideration if you wanted to get like Dema as a as an anchor I think he's great I think Dem is a really good player but you have the same problem if he was to play for an international team he is Ukrainian and he lives in Ukraine so he he would have you know a really tough time getting out of there so it's unfortunate for those guys the way that the world is and and how tough it is for them to get in and out of their country at the moment um yeah I I want to well this already exists on the record because I had a conversation about this a couple weeks ago um but the the game as far as it's going and evolving right we're not at a point where anybody is doing anything crazy all of the top teams play quite a similar style of Counter Strike right A lot of it is throwing these different opening configurations of util to imply or to take certain space right and there's obviously head-on counters but they normally require like a lot of util or direct like jewels and those become coin tosses like think about mid fights on Ancient for example if you can't get out mid and your Heaven guy can't get across heaven then on the T side you've used a red smoke a cave smoke a be Lane Molly two mid nades four flashes and you've used a lot of util in the start like for your opening move right and there's a lot of maps where you have stuff like that going on and then I think about utility usage what ever since aalis everybody has been quite good with their util usage the only thing at the moment with CS2 that is still a little bit being worked out is the best or most optimal ways to use smoke clearing right that is that is the one thing at the moment which I think could definitely have um more into it in the future and we'll see teams who become very proficient or situations that are better to use it than others or teams who hold on to their nades for long whatever right I'm sure there'll be some conversation about that down the line so the next Evolution for the game for me doesn't feel like it's going to necessarily be a tactical one it's going to be a Firepower element across all members of the team and I don't know if this is going to happen in the next two years the next five years the next 10 years but at some point the in-game leader will need to be a comparable level Fragger not a some not somebody who is offering a 0.8 rating right it's going to have to be someone who's closer to a one rating than a 0.8 rating and all pieces within the team are going to need to contribute in how the game is played and understanding and what we're already doing now in terms of our decision tree so I think the next Evolution for the game will come with big fragging in-game leaders like twist not don't have to be the star player of the team but somebody who is delivering high impact and again I don't know when that is going to be the case or if it will ever be the case but imagine we were living in that era which we were damn close to if NCO was the in-game leader of G2 twist was the in-game leader of liquid device is the in-game leader of astrales like okay holy [ __ ] we we all of those players can make a huge difference and then that's where it's going to become about the accountability of each and every member in the team and the support staff but I don't that's a conversation for five to 10 years I I just had like another point about the negativity side I think it's always going to come when a big team makes not a big move uh not an exciting move like for for for a proven name already but then again like we saw you know FaZe go for names like broi you know like that came out of completely nowhere he wasn't even an aler at that point then he look where he is now you know so at some point you just have to trust and you have to see because like what's the point of hating on it now like you don't know you don't know anything about this guy you can look into him you can look at his demos and then you can tell me if there's something there that you saw that you think is going to be [ __ ] you know I understand like holding like these big Orcs to to such a high level that they always have to go for somebody that's proven all that stuff but like you do have to bring up you you have to take a risk especially if you don't have the options and we were talking about some of the other options May not being the the most ideal anyway or being very expensive you know if it was like a SAS that would have been hell of an expensive move unless you know Falcons wanted him wanted him out already so like from all these perspectives I don't hate it I as everybody else I'm waiting to see how that pans out because who the [ __ ] knows at this point like he the guy hasn't played against top tier teams he has like one game against na'vi where he played well from two years ago with ago you know that that that's the only thing that we go off of you know that he has one game that he played against a good team that he actually played well in so like as far as as far as your evidence goes it's just there is none you have you just have to to to hope for the best all right well let's kind of put a bow on liquid for now we won't be seeing them until the blast groups uh so they still have a little bit of extra time to get the practice underway uh should we jump into a team that we will be seeing just uh just quick what are our expectations from this team uh to make the major that's I mean yeah I was going to say like that's kind of like a given but 10 to 15 area for this year is that you know I don't think Well I this I think like Championship contenders until I see more right maybe they will be but I I think like I think that's kind of where I put them like top eight like eight in the world uh like that's the upper limit and then lower like 15 to 20 well that I think the thing is with the amount of unknowns within this team if anybody was putting the expectations High it it would be with the potential not based off of the fact and the fact is this is the first team that twists ingame leading as Striker was just saying this is ultimate's first tier one team playing against the best other counter- strike players and opers in the world uh this is a opportunity for you kinder to turn it around which he already was on a little bit more of an uptick in recent times but still has this negative stigma around him not living up to the standard that he provided back when he was under Jame so there's three elements right there not only that now you have mither as a coach of this team you know he was obviously coaching Apex within that stint and then you go further back in time with Danish teams so how is he going to contribute to this roster uh jks hasn't been playing professional CS2 the last event that he played was IM Sydney of last year so he's been out of the professional circuit since that time he's also now 28 years of age uh or 27 I forget how old you I just's 28 now too probably his birthday is later in the year he is uh so there's also those things all to consider right there I think align more with your expectation that you've just put out their Prof as opposed to them being one of the top five best teams in the world for sure geez how is JK has about to be 29 December tell me where the years have gone Striker I'd love to know mate [ __ ] hell he joined he joined Vox EB when he was 18 yeah that's why cool uh okay let's talk a little bit about Furia uh as we mentioned a little bit earlier in the show quesado and Yuri have resigned um which I guess is quite a divisive thing within itself because of the interest that there's been around quesado for him to potentially go to different projects of International Teams it's quite clear now he wants to operate more down the tabs and routes I hate this man by the way what do you hate he's in prison himself by his own choice he's not in prison mate himself that's why I said it's like what is it uh it's been so he signed in 2018 is when Furia started kind of competing at the like at a higher level that's when they signed like the fiveyear or like 2019 obvious it would have been because now it's 24 right when he signed the fiveyear contract with fura since then he's had some interest just said no straight up said no to it and then he extends for another three years for eight years of your career you're spending with one team that hasn't achieved anything so far not achieved anything for his type of for his type of a player you know because he's a guy that's a lot of like he would have he would improve a lot of teams out there like any top team you would put him on he would probably be at least one for one just as good as that the player he would be replacing if not better but but hold up hold up hold up at what point do we stop this because he he doesn't want to do that that's my point I hate it because it's his Choice it's like this whole prison analogy it's like it only works if it's the Pablo Escobar prison where he built a prison for himself went there invited all his mates in that's that's keser's Furia prison right this is his choice he's having a great time there everybody everybody's loving it there's no problem the only people that find problem is like maybe someone from the outside not not him that's exactly the situation yeah nobody should feel bad for kado nobody should shed a single tear about what his career should have been same as tson if they want to continue to play in the projects that they're playing in we should merely respect that just like Stewie doesn't want to be spoken about guys we should respect these things and leave them where they lie and then we just talk about them being a team that maybe will be around the same as what we were just discussing with liquid you know somewhere in the top 20 maybe close to the top 10 occasionally never going to be great never going to be amazing and as long as you're getting kills and baiting your team every round who cares just keep the money coming let's just um winning is not for everybody Prof it's only for winners I wish I was you mean Striker I have I was looking at how old case so he's 24 now so his contract with was his new contract with fua is going to end at 27 and imagine it just goes the way that it has been so far and there's no indication that it won't there's no that will get better from here at the moment so for so what until 27 you are top realistically top player any of the year that you've played and you haven't been just because of sample size effectively because you haven't been able to play enough with this team to actually get there and then for all those years you're just not going to win anything even though you obviously have the quality for it so you're saying this team um you're not excited about it so the change of removing Gary but actually making him head of Esports now and more powerful and then putting the assistant coach from fura into not the assistant the he was the academy coach if I remember complete correctly to be the main coach and adding two International assistant coaches in inner shine and and Lucid this is not you don't feel like these are big changes that are like signaling a new era of Furia I think even the player one is is like up in the air like if you look at of course like scull is obviously going to be better than kai there's no denying about that but Kai was never supposed to be there in the first place so it's more like how does he even fit in because obviously like a lot of the spots that he has would have been kind of close to quesado anyway so there's just going to be a lot of passive pieces on this team obviously you know Yuri's real pretty aggressive CH pretty aggressive fallen for an oper realist is pretty aggressive but I don't know if it's enough for you to have a real Difference Maker but it's just kind of it's such a it it's a lateral move to lateral move to be at best it's not surely not a lateral move I mean not compared to Kai I I said like Kai let's just forget that he was there he was not supposed to be there regardless of what happened anyway you know but compare him to Art is he actually going to be that much better than art this is the problem this is the issue they got rid of Art and then they kept a a kid [ __ ] sleeping on their couch for 3 months like they didn't they haven't even played in the postart era yet because they decided just to use this Academy guy and this is a question that I'd love to throw to the room who the [ __ ] would they have gotten if liquid worked out and skulls was staying on the team like they got I mean there's a million Brazilian players they probably could have could have gotten I don't know how many of them are actually available but but they were they went with skulls which only became on the market recently right so kind of crazy yeah maybe that's what they were exactly waiting for you know to see if that's was work phelp say no already so you know that was that was the rumor that phelp said no to to Furia apparently so yeah there was something like that flirting around I don't know if that's true I think that would be kind of crazy to me by the way like they that they actually wanted to get him in for the first place like fine but that he actually said no to it is is insane I I think I think this would be better than it was with art but that's only if they play current meta Counter Strike and maybe in a and Lucid can bring them up to a bit more of a European Standard I think they're in Malta at the moment um I think I saw I don't think they have any influence on this team how how what kind of influence will they have on the team which is Brazilian with a Brazilian coach and Fallen in-game leading like they can they can provide whatever these guys ask them to provide but I don't think they can change anything well this is the thing if if if that's going to be the case then why even bring these guys in the first place this is what I think is the reason that they have this how do we say his name City Sid side I don't know whatever the assistant coach who's now the main coach I apologize I don't know how to pronounce your name I'm sure it has some accent to it but he is essentially it's better to have him behind the team than a coach who doesn't speak portug because you're going to find yourself in a situation where they're communicating the entire game in Portuguese you don't understand what's happening if the two analysts or like inshine and Lucid are able to offer up the answers this guy just takes their homework and all he needs to be there is in the timeouts to offer up the stuff that's already been discussed so if they're stupid they will just let fall and run everything but if they're smart and they want to embrace the modern game they will let these two come and have some influence and help mold and shape them because you can have the core that needs to be more aggressive of Yuri cello had fallen fine there can be your map control three then you can obviously have your anchors and then You' have quado as the more active anchor out of the two the one making them plays and going for the timings and skulls is the more passive guy right I think skulls will perform better in a Portuguese speaking team than he will on an English speaking team yeah that's probably true yeah so I think they will be better than they were but how good can they be I don't know I think the jury's still out on that one um I wanted to I wanted to talk about the scene you saw what I put in Discord earlier I wanted to talk about that at some point do we want to can we do that before we do the teer list because I think it's important to contextualize the direction that we're going let's do this Lucas can you run an ad break and we'll come back and then we'll get into that do you guys want to talk about anything more with the Brazilians before we run this ad break no I mean as you said like at least they have a team now this like whole interim period where no one really was interested to see them play except you know the Brazilian fan base um was boring as [ __ ] so now we can actually judge this team now they have like actual five I'm curious just about what the thinking is behind bringing in two other guys as well from the international side it's like okay you get a new coach already so that's like kind of a big change to a team we we're assuming and then you get two more and like is that too much is that too much input or are they doing it really just to try to see try to get more input in and so that they can kind of get out of their own Loop you know and get out of their mindset and and try to introduce something fresher to the system I don't know I mean that must be the reason but I feel like it's too many people at the same time for it to actually work and I'm curious about where that's going to take them right few things to look out for all right Lucas run this out break we'll be right back guys are you tired of your boring old skins

Arenas the feeling is still the same we live and breathe this game this was csgo through the lens by now at hltv.org [Music] shop all righty welcome back everybody thank you for sticking with us through the ad break there should be some exciting roster change news coming very soon uh but first we're going to sit here and we're going to talk about things from a broader perspective because we're about to get back underway with the second season of 2024 and I think it's important because not only uh do we do some punditry some commentary some journalism some live shows some entertainment all those different things into to hats uh we should also try and educate right because I think that's important and uh a season now and for the forceable future will be structured with the major at the end we can bring up this slide that I was working on today uh Lucas please and this is something that we talk about a lot when we're talking about Counterstrike it's about when teams are going to time their peaks and and what they're trying to Peak for and I think it's different for most teams uh but I would say one of the things that is integral is peing for what is at the tippy top of that mountain right there which is the Shanghai Mage at the last event of the Season uh so we have from July 15 to December 15 the season 154 days and only one major Champion uh is available right and it all kicks off starting on well Monday technically the tournament break ends on Monday the 15th of July the players are already back practicing or at least most of them and some have been going through out uh and I think at the moment and maybe why there's so much like hating and all of this that happens from Community sentiment is we go into a lot of these events and people are just expecting every team or their favorite team or the team who they think is the best to win every event and I don't think that's necessarily a realistic expectation uh so what I have created here and I didn't spend too much time on this it's just a path to the major which I said at the top of the mountain is the the perfect world uh major in Shanghai and where we start is the Esports World Cup next week in Saudi Arabia and that's the first event of the season right and then we go through the rest these are some of the more major events that are going to be happening throughout and the level of importance I put on one of the little peaks of the mountain there cologne uh which would be the next most important and prestigious event I would say throughout this season um are there any questions or takeaways from the the two of you gentlemen first first off just looking at this like I like I really like what you did here it's really great A+ for presentation and a for artistic expression thank you um um looking at it I think the only change I would make if we're making it like the higher I'd put higher but I didn't draw the mountains myself yeah yeah yeah I I think the only difference here is I think cologne is probably higher than all of these tournaments that are coming later uh including uh the fall fall finals World Finals and Rio I think I think cologne should be a bit higher and these all should be a bit lower but still higher than Esports World Cup Sky Sports and the group stages for for blast and eepl right that's the only difference but obviously you know the first Peak being cologne and then kind of I don't want to say a lull but let's say a bit less expectations for a while and then I build up again towards the the big peak which is which is the major yeah I I agree with that and and you're right if I if I draw on this cologne would be much higher and it's not meant to it's not meant to necessarily demonstrate a ramp up in terms of importance just getting closer and closer to the peak of the major so you all might need to use your imagination there a little bit but I I think cologne yes is the second most I should have put another flag there that's what I should have done a flag would have helped represent that better uh but I think that is that is the the key is cologne is in three weeks time so we have the Esports World Cup then we have Sky orts which is quite small considering the level of teams attending then we have blast groups which is normally our soft launch to the start of the Season uh now it's got a bit more of a condensed format and then straight into a prestigious event like cologne so Striker that's not a lot of time for these teams especially the newer rosters to get in in any great form I would say I mean of course the ones that actually don't play any ewc though those are probably going to be the ones that that are going to struggle the most just because of yeah I mean then you have kind of like the delayed start of groups into straight into cologne as we would have it in the previous year right or even at the beginning of the year with groups straight into Kavita basically so from that I think uh that's just going to put the same pressure on the new teams as it's as it would have been otherwise because what they they'll have one event to play together before they go straight into cologne so realistically for the likes of Cloud9 liquid they're probably not going to see cologne as as G2 I mean they're playing in ewc so they have a little bit more of a ramp up so they're going to have what two events up before cologne so it's obviously not a lot of time because it's less than a month but it's still a couple of events it's still reasonable amount of officials Reon reasonable amount of maps that you're going to get to play before you have to Peak obviously it's not like I would expect them to be at their best but at least it will be clone will still be important for them while I think for liquid Cloud9 probably not so much just because they like having some realistic expectations like you can't Peak after one event together especially after making changes as big as this so even though I'm sure they would like to perform as as well as they can in colog I mean who wouldn't it's probably unrealistic to expect them to to to finish anywhere high and it's more actual ramp up towards the the major where where we can expect more from those types of teams I I think I think this is because one thing that we tend to have a problem with when we come into these seasons is and this one we haven't had that many roster changes like everyone typing about the Cloud9 one we'll get to that in a minute um but you know how do you weigh all of these different teams up against each other right because it's it's difficult to do they all have different starting blocks Lucas if you could go back to the slide and then go down there's two more slides there that are just below that one and these ones are definitely not as pretty um if you could bring up the the one slide number two uh this is the yeah this is the current rosters like lifespan in months and I just saw this basic in from hael TV everyone can do it and put it in a lovely little graph but liquid and G2 well they don't have any same as Fury right those are the teams I didn't do all the teams Cloud9 is not on here for example uh but aralis have been together for four months spirit for six the longest is complexity at a year uh Mongols have been for a good 10 months right so you can see a bit of a disparity here and not everybody has the same starting so that starting Mark as well is different for different teams like phase and vitality towards the tail end of the season were probably a little bit disappointed right so do they want to hit the ground running or are they just going to be more realistic and so hey we just want to make sure we're hitting our Peak for the major for the RMR and for cologne right is is that is that going to be their main focus or do they think hey we're High Caliber teams and we want to try and be winning a lot of these events along the way so these are all questions that we don't have the answers to but doesn't get shared with us really either because teams don't come out and say hey this is just a warm-up event for us and maybe that's got something to do with them being partner events which does hurt the transparency and hopefully that's not the case next year teams can come out and say yeah this is just a warm-up event because I think that helps set the audience expectations too but I think we do he like at least even if they don't say it outright you can kind of tell from the way that they prepared if if you talk to them a little bit about how much Focus they put in before this event you know like a lot of the time you know I remember like one specific one would be for like Vitality for spring final last year or something they literally took break for like three weeks leading after that event so that already tells you a lot about their mindset for that tournament you know and like them lacking um focus in that time you know so you still get you still get enough to to have a decent idea it's just more like reading between the lines I really like the the difference if you go between these two like lifespan and maps played like if you go back and forth the the one team that really steps up is verus Pro like considering how small their lifespan is but they actually played more um comparison to everyone else is like going down and uh they are going they're going up in comparison which just shows in my opinion that they played almost too much uh after the electronic change and didn't have proper time to do any practice or anything so it'll be interesting to see them um after after the break when they had more time to put things together yeah I just wanted to show these visuals to everybody because it's something that we don't really like we we talk about it maybe on a desk or you know they have this Min game but the look at it like this I think it helps show where maybe team expectations should be at as as well um and also complexity we don't consider them a top five team in the world right but they're obviously happy with what they can get with the roster in terms of the funding and everything what what this shows is like teams like Vitality FaZe na'vi are in that area where usually roster changes happen if they are not winning right and I think by for all of all three of these teams they've been leading the leading the conversations about roster changes if we remove like liquid and G2 and obviously Furia who have already made them these seem to be the next one next ones in line and complexity and Mongols as you said obviously outliers and expectations are completely different for for these teams and they've been I would say Mongols overachieving complex the depends from from period to period sometimes over sometimes under underperforming yeah Mongols under underperforming today online uh they're bumped out of the blast qualifier unfortunately we you know online Counter-Strike best of ones who cares uh okay so I don't have too much more to add in that regard uh I suppose we should talk about this Cloud9 news just quickly and then we can get into doing the roster change tier list uh so let me just change the little bit at the bottom Cloud n roster announc yay uh I'll even put yay and I'll link Lucas the tweet and Lucas can bring the Tweet up and we can see the graphic okay awesome so the team was rumored to be heavy God inters and icy and guess what it's heavy God inters and icy um I think probably the more interesting and crazy story piece of this is the in's one for me he was the the the kid discarded early from Gambit and then he ends up uh back with axile at least or where signifies a lot with this club n roster because if you think about it inters was actually the one who like the change of Interest was the one that kicked all this off the downfall yeah exactly where where buter came in I don't realistically think that it was the wrong move to remove him but just maybe it just didn't matter you know at that time because like things happened down the line anyway way that that probably would have happened regardless of if he or muster was was on this roster so just uh yeah a little bit of a story there I think I hope he has a bit more autonomy as a player and isn't just a full anchor [ __ ] like I I want to see him do more I don't want to just see him just sit and do nothing because no one as a player should ever do that so I hope to get a bit more out of him heavy God obviously that's one that's been in the conversation for a very long time people have been saying that he speaks a Russian h interesting move for him I I I guess to make it is definitely an upgrade over OG that's not even a conversation Point um so I think he is the big signing P not intended uh he he's he's the the massive signing for this roster right he's the one where I think that the potential star power may have to come from alongside of axile um and axile inters I played a face it game with them and they didn't communic a lot and it made me sad so well neither of them are particularly good English speakers so yeah I told Axel that i' take him to Disneyland to cheer him up I don't even know if he understood what I said uh but I think we won the game so it's okay okay okay I just saw a forum thre that was minus inters and I thought people are already asking for him to be removed but it was just minus inters plus inters so that's that's fine I was like Jesus Christ guys like 11 minutes on a roster already asking for him to be cut um honestly it is it is a roster it's not it's not bad it is a roster it is a roster there are it's not bad like honestly the the signings I think the interest one's kind of weird but honest also haven't seen him play in Forever he's been in this like TSM Purgatory um loved him when he was on Cloud9 with all of his all of his limitations but uh also did did some nice stuff for to set up like shirou and the rest of the guys on the on the server back then I see somewhat promising but I I wasn't too impressed when I watched him play like at least you remember that nip overpass game yeah I saw some other games I think where he wasn't that that amazing but um obviously there's some problems I I think it's an okay lineup if we disregard what Cloud9 had before and just start fresh okay you know boom is there as the IG I think we believe that he can do something axile had a bit of an optic in in CS2 towards the end of the lineup so there's reasons that we can believe that this lineup is not going to be [ __ ] and obviously heavy got a lot of promise there so I think they can be competitive in the like top 20ish you know aiming towards the to get maybe close to top 10 that's kind of where I see this lineup honestly okay at least they have lineup now I was just thinking of poor Jack and thinking like he reinvested in Counterstrike and then he got this absolute cluster [ __ ] of a roster yeah this is what he's ended up with I mean especially especially if you consider like that they splashed out a lot for for the Perfecto um electronic one and that would have been umly didn't and then he got it he got a lot of it back probably for the sales to VP so and possibly one that will come for Perfecto at some point hopefully because he doesn't deserve to just stay on a bench and not do anything because he's locked behind a big contract but yeah I am on the same boat like if I was looking at this in complete isolation and just did not think about what Cloud9 could have been and uh what the previous roster was that's actually filling me with a little bit of Hope because maybe from the way we disregard everything that happens no but the point is the point I was going to make is because of how horribly the previous lineup failed and you know you can kind of point it to being down to Shiro just giving up on this roster too quickly or whatever it is you know that obviously played a big factor in in this lineup kind of spiraling because of the oper situation and then never really getting one up until now um but if you don't look at that obviously there were some issues that probably weren't fixable with just one roster change so just throwing the core out of the window and just getting some the younger players in who don't have these massive expectations and then who are more hungry maybe who are just going to be kind of a reset in mind mentality as well for for boich and Exile I think that makes a lot of sense anther was always kind of the soldier player who as I said I don't think he's going to make a massive difference to a team except for the fact that you can like offload a lot of the bad positions on him and he's gonna be fine with it like we've seen that before it's nothing bad about him it's just I don't expect him to be some Difference Maker so it's more going to be more about if heavy go and icy can make up for the Firepower that uh we that obviously especially electronic broughts to this lineup and even Perfecto towards the end of that stint um after changing positions he was doing pretty well so that's that's kind of my main concern and obviously lack of experience on those two guys against the the big teams but overall I don't I don't hate the moves because the ones that made perfect sense obviously didn't work for some reasons that are kind of hidden yeah yeah uh look I I the thing I'm most excited about to see Heavy go play against the T one teams so we we'll get to see that we saw like two games or something in some blast showdowns but uh a bit more now and we won't see them until blast anyway so they'll be playing at the same time as liquid with he's been I mean the few games that he's played against the decent teams he's been performing pretty well yeah um like he's played whatever I'm looking through all the all the big teams and like he's every time he's there he's always he's not just dropping off the face of the planet well he only played five against top 10 opponents by the way in all of his career but against top 20 108 which is pretty good or especially for a guy in his positions he's not exactly in Star positions well they might come up here let's jump into this uh well actually their logo is probably not here I think Demitri build a tier list is that correct Prof this is correct okay uh let's get into this so we're going to do a a t list I guess we're going to have to discuss how we're going to critique the roster changes I guess that'll play a big role in this there's another one that just came in another one that's the OG one um we have continued to search for correct roles over this slower Market period however we still need to meet the roster deadlines accordingly as such we will be Fielding a roster that includes Thomas who will take on the role of in-game leader for the blast full groups Thomas yes that's actually more exciting than I thought it was going to be good luck to you Thomas I hope that you find success and you can bring OG out of the darkness in counter- strike which they have always been ever since they decided to come into the game good luck you Ginger all right uh yes Prof here we go you were saying um yeah we have the tier list um I'm sharing it over here okay massive have Cloud n yeah nice okay massive upgrade upgrade mid downgrade massive downgrade Okay so we've got a bit of a spectrum going on here uh into the breach can we start with them yes okay massive upgrade yeah I mean we can probably well we can say that we can say that what even was the beus yeah that was the last one honestly massive up Thomas M beamus was the last like full roster that played together honestly all of these players pretty good will they do anything together we don't know and they could all shoot they can all shoot they all have like some decent experience playing you know major major qualifiers stuff like that I mean the the two bad news Eagles guys did quite a quite a bit boros back in the day with um BOS with with his playoffs and Paris you know I think smoa obviously what whatever you speak want to say about him always not always but usually performs pretty well even in these standings for fours speaking Russian and stuff like that so I think massive upgrade also super excited to just watch this team and see what's gonna happen behave level of Personality except I mean even Kos is kind of kind of a fun guy as well so it's gonna be it's G be a lot of energy I feel like knowing sman Kos this team might actually overcome Guild Eagles in terms of the loud just just the loud levels that they will bring out and even boros is not a guy who's just like completely calm as quiet and just not saying anything so I feel like I just hope they I just hope they qualify for I I think like getting to lands it's not going to be EAS that's going to be hard yeah that's going but if they even some like smaller stuff I think it's going to be so [ __ ] amazing and we're only measuring them by their previous roster so it's an upgrade uh big upgrade oh yeah and probably just on an experience factor I still don't think the team's going to be great but it's an upgrade uh they made the team older with the move of adding rigon over process I think process was 21 uh I think it just adds a little bit of spice because I don't think proes was really bringing much in terms of A Difference Maker or X Factor or anything like that and I think that's what Ron is he's obviously in positions where he's going to be very inconsistent they're a little bit different I was looking through I guess there's going to have to be some adjustments I would assume jdc is probably going to have to swap around a little bit just to to make up or to create some space for um for rigon so I'm curious about how they're going to solve that but he's obviously he's a guy who's aggressive who's going to take a lot of initiative and so I like that from Big um I think they have a decent roster that's one obvious change away from being good okay yeah what would you change more I mean isn't that obvious toson I think he's talking about the op yeah thon's been terrible man like he's he's averaging below 1.0 as an oper on the team which is horrible oh yeah it's not great uh but yeah they're a team who I put in the same category as big I mean as Furia they're just they're just their national team you know Furia has to be an upgrade over Kai like skulls for sure yeah I guess even I guess even over art you can probably say even though guess massive upgrade uh it depends on what you're comparing it to I don't think it's reasonable to compare it to Kai I don't think it's reasonable to compare it to Kai because we always knew that that was not the replacement like that's that was not a permanent solution he was there for three months what was he on a [ __ ] Euro trip you know he's in Australian he's got taken a [ __ ] Gap year or some [ __ ] like what the [ __ ] was that about I know yeah yeah I just feel like you know if it's not like a slam dunk move that's why I'm I don't want to put in massive upgrade if that makes sense like is it better yes it's better are we like yeah [ __ ] yeah this is this is what we were looking for I I'm not sure I'm okay either way but I'm I'm leaning towards just upgrade okay just just upgrade fine yeah um nine I don't even know who's on nine bro I was just going to check again I'm sure I know but I just I forgot completely R refresh man to muta sound compared to what the Polish team I guess mid mid mid mid is the definition of this don't really care until I see them somewhere I guess sound is good I like sound I I hope he's gets some like an actual chance somewhere some point if this team doesn't work out so um I I can look out for him uh throw [ __ ] n in mid no no no I think that's an upgrades we have a lot of plls in the chat or what happened they're saying downgrade oh they're saying downgrade they think nine is downgrade how the thing is like compared to the team that compared to the team that went to the major I guess you can comp that's the thing like probably not no I mean before this they had like back to yeah yeah no this is not we're not talking about minio goofy Kyler like had lineup that that's not that's I mean it is an upgrade over the last roster but overall kind of not exciting so wait people saying compared to the Polish roster yeah not the Polish roster that was good the Polish roster that followed that didn't do anything yeah so the poish Rost that we're comparing it to is minio Kai cucko bambo MHL Tomo yeah no one no one could no one could name that roster in chat I except like the one polish guy the people are talking about a roster that existed like two years ago yeah bro uh is Chill guys tell me is is wrinkle an upgrade to Fen oh my God what game are we playing okay well you wanted to put you wanted to put n not in mid put n what are we talking about Nitro returning the [ __ ] valerant player bro bro I'm I'm I'm he'll play for three months and then he I'm put it in downgrade I'm putting downg oh [ __ ] what are we talking about I thought we were okay what are we talking about here just you're talking about Nitro being a downgrade over wo I I don't care it's how can it be better how can it be based on what based on what is is getting a guy that has not played the game forever an upgrade on anyone and who was in the game and didn't do anything long that he left again why did he leave because he was amazing that's the that like if I look at it on a face like on complete Merit I mean I don't think there's there's an argument that you can say it's a downgrade over time the problem is like do we actually expect him to stay this time I think that's the question I don't care right that's where like I and that's not a dig at Nitro he's a lovely guy I just you he's flip-flopping more than [ __ ] Fish Out of Water bro like what are we what are we talking about um you can put what is the last was I was just being hatte I was just being a hater what's the last that's Pac-Man it's what oh it's it's BC game it's the guardians Guardians new team but we can't put that anywhere because it's not had they never had no just put him in mid then and move n back to Mid uh it's fine it is mid but I'm just I'm just I can't believe this is real I just can't believe I can't believe this team is real can't believe anything save G2 and liquid for the end bro save the the gold mate we're gonna go through the other teams first bleed upgrade um yeah say slight upgrade for sure at least yeah I agree with kad's statement I only read the headline about Nexa the stats and I agree I agree I think Nexa will be I don't know what the anything else the context of the comment was but I think Nexa will be better on bleed than he was on G2 yeah I think he was also he was also talking about how favon wasn't comfortable in the role that he was given and that it wasn't necessarily an indictment on him as a player they was good replace just didn't fit the role that they needed him to to fill and he was doing pretty terribly towards the end faven to be fair so there's no there's no question that this is uh this is going to be an upgrade what do you guys think about TSM I this is the let me just remind myself alte zph I like it for the fact that like all these guys found a team but all of it together doesn't really fill me with any excitement like all these guys I'm glad are staying in some form on a team but like I see a lot of these as like the final piece it's an upgrade over the the previous roster though which was Jack inter's Modo those kind of guys also like love love all of them but this is definition of washed team this is like North 2024 well this is like you washed your clothes and then you left it in the thing for like two days and you forgot about it and you open it it's like it's washed but you need to wash it again and that's it I do that too often I do that I do that every couple days what's the an analogy doesn't make any sense I just wanted to share that frustration of living and being an adult no these all these guys have been in decent teams and had opportunities and for sure two or three of these guys will bounce back and be like relevant again but all of them together the percentages just aren't there math doesn't work out for me it's not the finished it doesn't look finished no it looks like the of that may but imagine like imagine if they I don't know if you were about to say that but imagine if they had gotten blame and if they were supposed to that would have been at least interest more interesting in that just you know config hooky the rifle actually oh yeah yeah okay uh okay put TSM in upgrade CU it's better than the last roster but it should be M bro Danish get your Danish yes it's still up unfor I mean what are we talking about like are we talking about the whole thing are we talking about I think we're just talking about CTR realistically because the other team was there for a while so I think it's a downgrade I I was saying I was talking about this last time when we were briefly touching on how it affects G I like the idea of snacks as like the old Statesman on that team until he left for G2 so the fact that they are so young and they don't really have anybody experienced at the helm maybe Ash is going to be enough maybe that's that's where they get that experience from maybe they uh D3 is going to work with him well but I don't know I I'm just a bit worried that maybe they're going to need some time I think they expect that but it's more like I I'm on a a positivity Redemption Arc so I wouldn't put anyone in downgrade or massive downgrade [ __ ] you Chad uh I I just think it's pretty mid um but I'm happy to leave it in downgrade if that's the consensus the I mean I like I like the g g roster as a whole it's more like the last piece I also don't dislike ZTR for any reason it's more like you know you're putting it up up against slacks so difficult yeah uh okay mon everyone's favorite team Monty downgrade um what did you just say about not wanting to put anybody in downgrade that's why I said it quietly um so they lost voro they got Hades and they didn't continue with hajii and they got de yeah I don't think that's bad I don't think it's good to be honest but I but Hades is IG Ling which I think I think it's a reason why we can't say it's a downgrade yes I think that's fair but I think overall overall I'm not I don't hate it it's more like war was actually really important to this team it was kind of dying and living and dying with him so the fact that he left is the is what just feels me with a lot of concern like he was by far the best player on this roster especially after SD left so now that's like you you can think of a deha as like a direct replacement for SD I suppose and they kind of switched places if you think about it yeah I don't think that what we saw with I don't think that what we saw with diha at the end of anus is real level um I do think that he's he's going to be better than that but is that going to be enough for this team to actually work I don't know seems like there's not going to be enough firep power yeah I mean one thing is that the Monty guys like lmbt coaching they managed to extract more value out of all of the players than what they should have historically um and Hades and diha both have potential not that have potential like we saw them play good at different times so there's some angle there to be hopeful about but I I think it's still what Sher said about losing voro it makes makes the downgrade unfortunately uh okay Cloud n are we comparing them to their previous roster or the fact that they had no roster because might I think we have to compare PR Hobbit Hobbit perf electronic which would be the problem is like when we know how it actually went I don't know if you can necessarily say that come on I know I know but that's the point like we actually expected a lot from this Cloud n and then they didn't do anything we yeah but look that looking at their results the results were bad so like are they so do we think their results are going to be decent at least at the same level oh wait I'm I'm just looking through their results back because I forgot where where they went out I know they went out pretty early in most of this this stuff but hbert Perfecto electronic like name for name the thing is if we're using what we know happened as the context for this and not just looking at the roster then it's still a downgrade like it either is downgrade or massive downgrade yeah but realistically a top eight that the major is the only thing that this roster achieved the previous roster achieved the everything else was just bombing out early we got to put someone in massive downgrade and if it's Cloud n all right I agree with you I don't think the roster is that bad I don't like it's not it's not it's not that bad I agree with you on the name value I agree with you on like piece for piece like there's no there's no denying that but knowing that it didn't work I don't know if you can say that you know well we can't say it's an upgrade it's not an upgrade so it's we can just put it in downgrade but we can't put it anywhere else put it in downgrade put it in downgrade it's fine okay okay all right uh liquid this is another one it's similar that would be a similar thing um I would say straight down middle mid honestly mid honestly mid okay is that because of the compromises that were made with like R like leading and everything I yeah but I mean nothing there it's not like they made a massive upgrade signing uh I think like jks for calls is better but also think ultimate is huge question mark and also the IG Ling on twist is a question mark therefore I think it kind of neutralizes itself I don't think it's a upgrade I don't think it's a downgrade I think it's solving problems and that's it yeah that's fair I am hoping that we will see more like aligned liquid moving forward because clearly this is going to be twist theme now and he was the one building a lot of it so um hopefully that means that all this talk about having problems making it all fit together are going to be solved I think jkss will help with that actually a lot because he does fit in a lot of those positions so and lastly the T the show's least favorite team G2 Esports the team we always never talk about except when we always talk about them but never where are we putting G2 can you remove them from the Massa down great for now yeah I don't lie this is going to become a screenshot that this going to be just It's upsetting me [Music] uh I okay let's let's break it down let's break it down let's break it we had two changes we had hookie for snacks and we had um we have to put a next for Ms we surely have to put a mid as well because think about it I it's the same problem with liquid basically well it's a inverse problem when you think about CT versus T sides but still question marks around a lot of the factors like it's not that we know if snack's can game lead or not he can because did it at game leion did it before that but it's gonna how is this team going to work with him as the leader and then Mals in new positions and how is the give and take of all of that going to work so I think for me and it kind of Alliance for what we are doing here is if we see that a player we have a player for player replacement where we see that this player should be better that's that's an upgrade but if we have player for player where it's either kind of similar or it kind of cancels out or it's just unknown how this is going to work then we can't really say it's an upgrade that's that's that's kind of the consensus that we found here and that's why I think it's it's mid because it's very could work could be awful yeah okay yeah put it in mid that's fine yeah I think you can obviously you can say mobs is probably going to be pretty big upgrade over next but the problem is it's not a one for one replacement so it's like there's going to be a lot more that's going to go into that discussion yeah yeah uh okay cool well that's the tier list uh for the well some of the roster Changers obviously the og1 we don't have and whatnot but that's that's what we got uh let's jump into our next little sponsored bit it's what of the odds brought to you by one expert this is where you at home get to have your say and this week Prof the question is I'll wait for it to show up because I can't remember I exactly I should have done a longer drum roll what are the odds Ms will have a better rating than skulls at ewc and that friends uh in lies the problem that we all have now you at home like I said will get a chance to vote on Twitter or on Instagram uh or what the kids used to be calling Twitter let's put some information out there just as people are start going to start voting some things to keep in mind Fury are playing na'vi first are playing Mongols first it's not going to eliminate either of them but chances are they're not going to come back from it because they have to basically win the last chain stage which just seven other teams best of ones as well and oh yeah and best of we'll get into that format that's I'm just saying like for for context sake and for people to have all the information to to make a decision obviously Mal's better form probably better player than skulls but where will skulls play will he have where will MBS play from from the interview he did with um Darth mik he did say he's gonna take anchoring rolles Mal Ms did um maybe like big site anchoring roles and tside map control and tside map control which is not the worst r i mean tside should be good for him tside should work yeah he said he should get more or less what he wants so I feel like it it should lean towards his side but um these are both two players coming into new rosters how much will that affect everything BS will get more action just purely because he will be playing more active roles on the tside whereas skulls are will be playing extremities and I think he'll just be the [ __ ] on both sides of the map I think he will be the more passive as opposed to quesado so they also have a harder match up first round so I'm going to say by just pure productivity of what Mals might be able to deliver uh and even yeah I'm going to go with Mals and I'm going to go with 72% I was going to say 70 as well so you can slap me on 70 yeah I'll go with 80 okay seems wow yeah are we having the the votes also going so soing let's see what what the chat says but it seems like realistically the odds maybe are 87 there we go Jesus okay the chat higher than us that's crazy cuz like all right no faith in uh no faith in the Furia young signing maybe they're just all taking into consideration the positions I mean but it's also that mobs is obviously like much more of a star player than skulls ever was so in terms of where he plays how he plays taking with snacks where just look just looking at new signings and seeing like how they will perform and kind of do doing some comparisons but it will be uh yeah seems like a pretty pretty obvious selection here maybe easily adding a bit more uh money to the kitty as as we like to call it well now the way this works for everybody you on social media will get a chance to vote uh you can either go with the yes which is going to n you 65 bucks for the kitty or 217 if you think we'll be wrong and you think skulls will get there maybe all of Brazilian Counterstrike can get behind skulls on the social media and get the no vote coming through but you guys can take part in that that is 1x bet presenting what of the odds all right keep flowing let's keep rolling let's keep grooving let's keep shaking let's get into The Fall season uh which we've already prefaced a little bit we showed the the mountain graphic before we did all that jazz we've also spoken about a lot of teams we've also spoken a little bit about uh ewc but first thing we're going to do before we get there is uh do skin a so from sponsor segment to sponsor segment is it me doing it is it Striker doing it what's going on with this week's skin a who who would like to do it you want to do it I haven't done a lot I haven't done one in a while so okay all right all right well skire brought to you by Trad at. if you're interested in taking part type Trader in chat right now that'll be your raffle ticket to enter the draw for what could potentially be a $50 skin voucher to use at your leisure over at tradeit.gg all right all right all right multiple choice questions five of which every correct question moves the slider up and somebody will be going home with that voucher let's get into it question number one which team was I'm going to call him seed was for before becoming furia's coach was it fluxo pain or Furia with an exclamation point we were talking about this he was in the academy team right so in C Furia the correct answer is furi all right one for one nice soft start question number two before joining bc. game as coach Guardian played for lock it in sampy it a organization so but sometimes we have audio only listener Striker and they would to have known both uh sorry all of the options which was Singularity and sinners yeah all right let let the host finish asking the question next uh question number three who is not on the new TSM roster is it a Altex b tnb c zon zon well honestly if I didn't see this before one of the hardest questions ever to be asked on skire okay three out of three we're flying through this one question number four who's the highest rated with 50 maps played no filters uh player from Oceania in 2024 is a a addict B ins or C netic from New Zealand I was just looking at netic because I was writing about the the news I don't think he was that high and everybody in Oceania is [ __ ] inflated as hell because they're playing you know like the top eight team there is is obviously nothing comparable to anything in Europe or anywhere outside of that but uh this would be this that's the thing like ins has been playing well against the top teams but he hasn't played so much against some of like some of these other guys in Oceania I I mean in is an obvious one I still want to go with that that one I'm not 100% sure though I feel like there's this could be a curve ball going to have to press you for an answer strike did I oh you've already answered oh well I think you're going to be wrong let's see correct answer is it was actually him okay yeah he Farms everybody in Oceania he is a lead farmer also addict is also from New Zealand as well this respect to the anything else you know about this guy except that he's joining Talon with ASR he shoots good yeah I I can't well I don't know I'll ask I can start talking about it or not okay he's been he's been one of the guys that people have been talking about as like the next fqu player so possibly some somewhere down the line he's been on the same team for like four years man it was kind of crazy to me he's been there since he was like 16 on rooster yeah I i' I think I've spoken that like people should be aware that I've be been advising Talon for some time now I've mentioned it a bunch so uh there'll be I don't know if there'll be news I don't know what they're doing with an announcement and I I don't want to I don't want to spoil the party and all the fun and stuff but uh obviously it's only really a big one for the region I don't think the world Counter-Strike SC is going to have too much interest in it it's just one of the things that I would have been advising the fly Quest guys to do when they were Greyhound as well and I think one of the reasons they didn't go with Talon and went with fly Quest instead is because I said to them that if they hadn't had better results come Dallas that I would be pushing the org to look for roster changes in two positions and one of them would be getting a European orer so maybe that's why they went with fly Quest so my bad I just thought it was it's important to be honest I just you know um okay well we can only get four out of the five but that's all right question number five [ __ ] I lost my tab which player is not on the new Revan team led by NB okay NAA LS or sound we were just talking about sound um so him locking it in uh C correct answer is sound and that's going to be a $15 voucher for tradeit.gg given to one lucky winner Lucas is going to put their name in the chat and their name [Music] is daily ton d d delish D A1 l y T1 n congratulations our people out to your people and get you your voucher to use at Trad at. for some skins of your choice all right skin you done um get keep we're keeping up the fun in games okay we spoke about it there's going to be a whole season ahead of us uh it's going to be starting with the Esports World Cup next week 15 teams attending that one we'll talk about that event next but let's do some uh big predictions we did it at the start of the year we did a little time capsu for uh you know different little markers who's going to be the team of the season who's going to win the major who's going to have roster changes and we're going to do it again right now uh because it's something great that we can return back to throughout the season check in after the major see how right or how wrong we were uh so we have that one ready and raring to go and I Lucas do you have the link or would you like me to send it to you I'll send the link in right now there you go you can whack that one up uh and we'll we'll get going with it so this one uh is has the same those questions or predictions the predictions would probably be better that are being made and those are going to be uh don't make the major Shanghai major MVP Shanghai major winner uh team of the season and team to make roster changes now I've already filled mine out so we can start with mine or we could just go oh props f is out right now I fill mine out as well even though contemplating one I didn't F anything well that's all right I went with uh pretty straight shooting last time round I predicted the G and Graham wouldn't make the major this time I've gone for something which is probably equally as consumable digestable for the audience I'm going with Falcons not making the major uh I think they probably tried to make roster changes throughout the break but here's the thing with an organization like Falcons they're a team that has to win so if they have another [ __ ] season uh they will 100% be very aggressive roster Changers I would assume going forward with big Personnel getting cut from that team and hopefully looking to pick up some bigger names um and and I think I went with FaZe players I think I had robs as major MVP and I had FaZe winning the major last time round so this time around I'm going to go with spirit I think another four or five months under their belt of playing top tier Counter-Strike if they can continue to pick up where they left off they don't have to win everything they just need a peak for the major H get some more reps and Arenas under their belt and and play a few more tournaments unlike some of the ones they missed for the last season so I'm going to go with Don as the major MVP I'm going to go with Spirit as the major winners which would make team spirit the team of the season uh and I think na'vi will make roster changes so nothing too crazy there all right I wouldn't say uh okay what do what do you got Striker let's let's flick to Strikers if we can Lucas I didn't want to go with Falcons for they don't make a major so that I think would have been kind of an obvious one maybe another obvious one also would be Club N I don't even know if they're going to get invited man because they don't have a core um so that's obviously already One Step that they have to pass they have to do well at the groups and they probably have to play some other stuff some online stuff if they want to make it to the whatever it is top 48 right in in Europe so already from that angle it's going to be difficult and I think even despite that it's probably coming too quickly for a team that's just changed the entire core even though I like as we said like I don't hate this roster I actually do think that they are capable of making it to Majors I just think maybe it's going to be too early okay uh and shanai major I was going to go I was going somewhat similar to last time last time I went with vitar winning and D getting the MVP which honestly wasn't such a crazy punt in the end uh this time I'm going with M winning and dunk getting the MVP so let's see if a second try this is a bit of a honestly I don't know if I actually believe this outsid pick for sure it is an outsider pick it's more like I think the the trajectory is there and it's more about mes getting the over the the arena hurdle if there is if there was even one a lot of the arena games they they lost to faas uh and FaZe are on the way down so hopefully if they meet them again it's not going to go the same way as uh as so far they're finally going to break that streak so I don't know I think I think they really have an impressive roster I think they they will be somewhere in the discussion for for a win at the at the major and I just think they're the one of the few teams that actually have been able to to beat spirits and that's why I feel like they might beat them in a final but dunk is going to be the MVP because none of ma are going to be standing out enough to get the MVP over a guy all D so that's just kind of my thinking around it uh just figured that would not go with something as obvious as just Spirit winning the major okay still as team of the season and then yeah exactly make roster changes Falcons and VP yeah I think VP vp1 I think there's the writing is kind of on the on the wall with uh I did an interview with the VP CEO who was kind of saying how this electronic signing kind of gives a sign to a lot of the big players from the region that VP is is here to make some big changes and I think there's one that's not there's one specific one but maybe that one could be very obvious obviously Mony like but he's probably not leaving G2 anytime soon not not in time for this to come true I think but realistically I think there's there's definitely a world where they will undergo more changes because just this electronic one isn't going to be enough to change the team and that might as well come like right after the major I don't think it's going to be until the major because it's they're probably they're probably going to qualify even if they're not going to do well at the major but I don't think that this trajectory that they've been on is going to change necessarily too much maybe they're going to have a decent result here and there but if they have a good enough upgrade like a Perfecto I think they're going to jump on it yeah I think Perfecto makes a lot of sense and we'll see what what else um guess FAL I think is a sub super obvious one by the way I think there's I I expected one to happen this season already but I don't know if they they couldn't get anyone that's what I was thinking maybe they just couldn't get anybody good enough that would have actually changed anything about this team so um I think it's just a matter of time all right let's uh jump in profs if we could please Lucas thank you all right Prof to I was I'm doing it last minute so I I actually went for kind of of exactly what what Striker went with so then I kind of changed it the Shanghai in terms of the major winner Major MVP um and and team of the season so I kind of I think I did the inverse now um so don't make the major output complexity um I know they should and I know they're playing in an NA which is not that bad but I think with some other upgrades maybe maybe there's a maybe there's there's a chance for some some UPS I feel like they didn't really do anything new they're just taking their guns which could bite them in the ass come come RMR um you were showing that they were the longest standing team out of the 10 teams you were looking at out of the ones I listed yeah they've been together for 12 months the next 10 I just think I don't know I feel like they they could have and should have made made some moves but whatever anyway uh I guess it also is is difficult because of the whole organizational change and like Jason Lake buying it back back there they are probably focused just on making things work and kind of building up the or again outside of the game Square ownership uh for Shanghai major I went with spirit and donk MVP um obviously you kind of you kind of want to back the big players which is like Mona and and zyu but G2 is complete question mark and vitality has been hit and miss so I believe Spirit make a lot of sense and the other one would be Mouse I think Mouse would be really good and that's why I went for them as team of the season because I think they can they can have that consistency to to be the best team of the season Prof they've only been beating everybody because of this [ __ ] razor keyboard that Jimmy's put out there the [ __ ] snap tap whatever it's called yeah but it's the counter to the Donk slide but this is now you're using like mammo against me using Y I was just I just wanted to to talk about the keyboard because it's no the keyboard but the keyboard apparently G2 used it in I I was talking to [ __ ] I was yeah I just I am just putting it out there like it does make sense it's a great argument but uh a lot of people and I know some phase players were using some Razor stuff U through the events so it's not it's not like just because uh what the mouse is sponsored by Razer that they are the only one using this Armstrong they've got [ __ ] I don't know I haven't used this actually but everyone told me it's [ __ ] ridiculous thetic binds that I tweeted I lent it I lent it to a to a certain check player I'm not goingon to say his name because I don't know if he if I can if he's okay to uh to possibly promote uh uh let's say competing Brands but he exact he told me exactly what it does within 10 seconds like that's how quickly he keep he he saw the difference I didn't tell him like I just told him okay here here's this thing that's apparently fix his movement I didn't tell him exactly what it does he just tried it out for 10 seconds and it told me what it does so that's how that's how big of a change it apparently is um does anyone want to explain how it works Chad I I I would need rush I mean effectiv I mean I think I think rups uh explained it the best way uh that effectively it is kind of like a macro thing where if you're ading like if you're counter strafing you're like as you press a and then you press D the D is completely going to um over override the previous command of the a you know so like you're you you stop way quick way more quickly like you counter strafe way more quickly way more accurately you know which just makes it kind of impossible for you to make a mistake or over step too far because just the response is much faster you know in terms of uh going the other way you know if you're like corner peing and things like this this to me it doesn't feel right though like we're we're putting like little little computers in our keyboards doesn't make sense it's not pure input but the thing is what we were talking about before because we already had this discussion regarding woin keyboards a little while ago right about the um [ __ ] I forgot the term but it's about how Sensi the keys would be the actuation of the key and the release point on the key this is that on steroids right so uh you're going to come into areas where I'm curious how this stuff will be policed for online Counterstrike if they did want to police it for land obviously it's something they can do you know I only learned the other day that there's certain monitors that get sold out there where you can have a Crosshair built into the monitor so I mean that's been the case for like I know but I I didn't know that cuz I don't use [ __ ] dog [ __ ] brand monitors I only use the good one um and when I heard that I was like people like I know it would really help you with an or or a scout but imagine always having an or or a scout with a Crosshair at all I mean people the the joke is that like people on like local lands and stuff or like people at home would just like paint paint a dot in the middle of their monitor I mean I did that when I was like 11 or some [ __ ] you know like as I was starting in CS and and learning the op like it's a it's actually quite a useful tool but obviously not to use in like professional competitive setting yes Lucas I I know it's uh not The Counter Strike but uh there are monitors out there now with AI buildin that when you play League of Legends it automatically looks at your mini map and then it will paint like uh red areas where there's enemies close to you and warn you in the middle of the screen so you don't have to like watch the game anymore like the minim like you don't have to look at the mini yeah so imagine you know a monitor who that looks at your mini map in CS and if your friend like spots a guy in smoke it will warn you if you're looking towards the guy like is that's hardw cheat yeah that's cheating yeah so it's a it's kind of questionable for me I know uh Mel slinsky tweeted that it's okay to be used but I'm also curious why what's the what's the logic and where do we draw you know the line because it seems very like I'm I'm bad at counter strafing I feel like this is like I should be bad at counter strafing it shouldn't fix it for Me by just the problem is and Counter Strike is still dog like in CS2 it's not it the biggest issue I had with CS2 in the beginning and the reason I tweeted out those subti those D subti binds is because it made movement feel better less slidy for me and I think it was probably sented does well by the way yeah but but that right there that's huge right obviously the C if you think is the key component of this but [ __ ] I hated the way CSU felt in the beginning I felt like I could never I was just always sliding and and to d sub tick it kind of helped you guys see the Freakazoid clip on rdit the other day with the the jump bug thing there's and I was also I've also been uh talking with valin DMS just briefly nothing crazy but about the Boost I told them like two weeks ago or whatever that the Boost bug still exists and they wanted me to start sending demos of rounds where it happens but I told them you can't see it so but they still wanted me to send a couple of demos which I have done and I had it happen with me and Harry the other day on Ancient and then we went in a server immediately after and tried it in the exact same position and it doesn't trigger so I I even able yeah I even clipped I clipped because the new thing that steam have added which is [ __ ] awesome like the the re getting recorded so good so you can clip everything all the time I just have that going and if any of the bugs happen I just clip that immediately and just [ __ ] send it so hopefully they can find the fix for that because that's uh that I think is of the biggest issues at the moment some of the movement things and definitely the Boost um okay let's go back to my think I didn't finish I think the oh you on the slide bring the slide back up um I changed I changed my don't make the major I put in a tnal fire I that's that's the vibe that's the vibe I'm getting from I think it's more more reasonable just because of the na thing with complexity you know more likely uh I didn't finish with Team to make roster I put fa and na'vi I think na'vi pretty obvious everyone but I I feel like there's something going to happen in FaZe I feel like this is not going to be the the season that they want it to be and there will be some some changes that's my complete Vibe all right well we'll take this out back we'll bury it and we'll dig it up uh in six months time once we get to the end of the season and we'll see how we all fed uh with our little time captal predictions all right let's jump jump into the final piece you didn't talk about F and na'vi making changes no what I just talk about na is obvious and then he said for FaZe he doesn't think it's going to be the season that they hope it's going to be okay and and yeah but I I stopped listening for the five seconds that he said that bro on doubt it's all good all right let's get into this ewc weird format uh that's the main conversation point there not going to do anything too crazy with predictions because we can't really we haven't had any teams playing uh the the key is going to be the format so uh Lucas I'll send the link in here and you're going to have to play along with little drop down tabs as we talk through the format so uh it's 15 teams which is already curious and you're asking yourself why is it 15 teams well everybody let's show you so we'll bring this up the first one with the opening stage okay never mind I was going to say like I can make it very simple how this works well I it's because it's that's the point like it looks whack but it's actually extremely simple but but it's but I think the thing is it's very different which makes it quite curious for people right it's not just it's not just like broken up into two different groups with a 16 team event like you might expect from ISL for example it's it's it's not a format where you win two games and you're automatically in the playoffs it's actually this opening stage is hugely important and considering the context of this being the first event out of the break it's insane how important this first best of three is especially in matchups like VP vers complexity uh maybe na'vi versus Furia to some extent right it if you're G2 versus Mongols because this is the opening round it's seven best of Threes And winning the best of three here will put you into the playoff bracket right the the problem I me the better the better way to think about it is basically as just a single elimination bracket with just like a second St second chance for the first round losers effectively because they'll whoever comes out of the eight Losers of the first round will just join the next round of the playoffs effectively like it is basically a a a 16 team uh single elimination except the first round you actually get a second chance so it's not even that round that like everything else is just single elimination the first round is actually not that important because you still got a chance obviously you have to win out of eight teams in the next stage but it's still a second chance I would say it's important because of course it's but it's it's the same it's less important than winning the next game because that actually eliminates you you know and then winning the next game which actually eliminates you sure but the the thing with this opening opening round is with the context of it being the first uh game of the new season term through the through the through the event of course but think about how crazy upsets would be in this first round and what ramification they would have if we have two or three upsets in the first round and you're going to have a loser from VP complexity right you so think about how crazy a single elimination best of one bracket could be so that's the first component and also I think that if people look at what they just saw and think that that's how the bracket's going to flow which surely it can't be like that right because then it would be m versus Spirit if they both win in the next round like that that could yeah that doesn't doesn't seem right espe look at lower down it's just phas and G2 on one side with uh no other top going to be seated after after yeah hopefully now this is the best of ones where Gigi how is at already uh so it's essentially first day 1 2 3 four five seven best of Threes first day and then all of the best of ones are being played the second day and then then you kind of move into the playoffs our best of three yeah yeah but it's just it's a curious format it's a it's a a very unique looking format uh and I'll be and considering how Cutthroat it is with the start to the new season and a couple of new rosters in there it should be uh it should be interesting it's not as soft as a blast group stage to start that we it's about as much as much to the other side as it almost possibly could be except for the first round yeah but I I look I always like to think a little bit different I don't know how I feel about this considering how much prize money is up for grabs at this event it's like 400k first prize there's also broader context which our fans won't really care about or Counter-Strike fans won't really care about which is for ewc it's a bit more like a Syndicate type thing for a shitload of prize money so depending on how you do across all of your games if you're the top org over all your games you can win or something a lot of money yeah so it's weird that that's the case considering the timing with our game and what our teams are going to be really gunning for at the start of this which isn't necessarily going to be the W but yeah I I feel like in like DOTA and some other Esports it's very big um n CS is just a tournament that no one really cares about that much to be honest um it's just a tournament that format is I I don't know why it's like this makes not I I'm impressed that someone would come up with this I feel like you have to be on drugs to come up with this kind of a format like it's so like how how do you even get like 15 teams and it's like okay we'll figure out a way to to make this work uh but okay whatever um I don't think it's fair or that makes a lot of sense that like losing the first one is fine but losing the second game is not fine I think it's just okay whatever but um it's it's a tournament um I think ju it has the all the best teams which is like nine top nine teams ranked according to hltv right now in the world so it's it's going to be important you can't really ignore it either regardless of all of the Saudi hating Saudi and the Esports World Cup it's not really something you can be like ah let's just not talk about this because it is CS after all that we that we talk about everything time yeah well who's missing heroic who's number 10 actually Hero's number 10 heroic 10 wait yeah not there is eight so six yeah so it's top seven plus nine yeah yeah liquid also didn't qualify um back whenever they were supposed to qualify so they're also missing from like the big teams finally enough Falcons who have like this amazing [ __ ] Esports rosters and they're probably going to and the whole the whole [ __ ] game game wide thing they're not even playing in this tournament ver yeah yeah so I don't think there's any point us doing predictions right coming out of the player break it doesn't really make much sense I think upset potential is at an all-time high at moments like this so I just I just think the headlines read G2 debut and furier debut uh otherwise it's about teams picking up where they left off last season or hoping for better Seasons this SU round uh and do you know anything about who is boot camping who's not boot camping I know that spe started yeah um and g2's in Serbia and that's more or less I haven't seen much to be honest I haven't been on the I think fa a boot camping for this I don't think so I haven't seen um so I think they're just cracking from home yeah I I don't I don't know I kind of feel like Spirit are the guys like anything except play CS the whole summer yeah spirit is boot camping for sure I saw something um na'vi boot camping g2r boot camping for sure and then I don't know what else which probably the only time you're going to get to boot camp before makes yeah exactly now we makes sense because they were talking about this for a while that they haven't gotten a good boot camp in for a while and that they wanted to do that in the offseason so makes sense okay well this tournament starts on Tuesday next week uh and yeah that's that's about it and we're back underway and Wednesday is it no it can't be Wednesday it is Wednesday how can it be Wednesday is it really Wednesday it is Wednesday [ __ ] I thought it's five days I thought it was starting on Tuesday no it's five days why am I flying in on Monday then [ __ ] it uh I mean Tuesday is probably media media yeah that does make sense okay never mind it all it all works out in the wash there doesn't it okay uh we'll be back for an episode on the 2 3rd uh that's Tuesday the 23rd of July uh and then we're going to do one just before blast groups start on like Sunday the 4th I saw someone ask in the chat a little bit earlier if we could announce shows earlier yeah uh so we'll try and do that sometimes it's not easy with how we get from point A to point B and everything that's going on but we we'll do our best uh this upcoming season we'll probably have try and do a couple of different things um and we'll see how we go with that but uh yeah I think that's that's about it gentlemen isn't it yeah if uh if people have any thoughts on maybe some stuff that we did before on confirm that they liked or [ __ ] like that some updates are are coming so please let us know on YouTube comments or wherever DMS that would be
