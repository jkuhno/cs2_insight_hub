that I think he played mid to paor okay and I think he would think he played mid to poor but fortunately twist and Naf amazing Beast they are amazing like those the [ __ ] out of me because he's the one who's been like he's always been Mr I can do everything and he's been moved around a billion times and somehow he's just he keeps doing it and he's like in the best form that I've seen him in a

joining us now if you're not familiar with P then you're probably 16 years of age uh and that's okay you know some of you are young we do have a newer audience we've definitely got an older audience but for those of you who the uninitiated uh look a 1.6 player the tail end at 1.6 playing for legendary organizations such as fanatic then into the early stages of csgo was playing in the SK gamings uh coaching nip and a whole bunch of slew even went over to North America for a while and enjoyed a bit of what CLG had to offer pet thank you for joining us tonight uh what what's going on mate uh good question actually um oh time time flies uh I've been uh away for what is it six seven months but feels like these months just flown flown by really quick um mostly just just uh doing some Swedish commentary uh following the Swedish teams or at least the teams that have Swedish players in them so that's what I'm doing right now obviously also uh trying to get back to coaching but uh yeah see what we'll see what happen well you don't like being on the broadcast man you don't like doing the the commentary stuff or you'd prefer to be involved with the team um I think the team uh is is definitely where I want to be but uh I think um just you know doing some commentaries is uh making sure I am still up to date uh following the scene and um yeah and that's what I do right now you never have to worry about winning or losing though if you're if you're only commentating so yeah I see my L Lucas I see I'll try and fix it man give me a second all right all right you guys keep the conversation going I'm G to try and fix my webcam how does that sound that sound good for everybody that sounds that sounds great yeah um yeah I mean Swedish summer though pretty pretty dank I can uh I can can confirm ATT test to are you man don't we like 10 year what what year is it said D I haven't heard the word d in like 15 years I'm old I'm old I'm definitely an old guy now but uh but yeah I don't know um just talking from your experience as you said you know Swedish teams you're following Swedish teams or teams with Swedish uh players because if it's only Swedish teams there's not that much to follow what's the what's the vibe right now uh about Sweden how do you feel right now I mean we we have fallen soow um in in Swedish CS compared to what we had 10 years ago or or even less so now we're just happy you know if we have one Swedish guy then obviously we will U follow follow him and yeah I mean it is what it is but I think Swedish SE is is on the uprise uh I really do and uh I think maybe like year or two I think twer CS might be coming back uh we'll see all right well Johnny speed's out there my webcam is fixed Luc just has to to put me in but I'm back all right a quick little technical fix it'll probably die again about three to four more different times and if people see me swatting around the room there is one fly in my house somehow and it's been annoying me all day so uh yeah I apologize for that but um look I want to get into tonight's conversation we have a lot to talk about there's obviously blast groups that have just come to their conclusion then we have colog and I think a lot of that conversation is going to be quite meshed together um it'll be intertwined so and and also it's going to be difficult tonight to draw hard conclusions but maybe we can I don't know I'm not sure I I want to I want to delve into your Tweet a little bit later when we talk about G2 p with the one you made about um them being good in the short run I think that'll be because I I agree with that I'd like to to hear a bit more about that so um do we have any other housekeeping that we need to do Prof about Cologne coming up or anything like that like in terms of our live event before we yeah I mean we're doing we're doing the live event in Experian it's it's sold out in like one day 24 hours or something so don't really need to do anything much about that uh but you know people can uh tune in it's going to be on Thursday so night before the the playoffs start um also just we'll on the lookout for for guests or players or people around that that are interested hit me up hit me up uh about that that's okay all right nothing crazy all right well uh I guess let's get into into the chitchat now run the bumper Lucas let's talk about some recent [Music] news all right we're back and not a lot of recent news really to discuss most of it's going to be about the results and the preview for cologne uh but I have spoken I would say a decent amount about the the Talon team um but apparently not enough for most people to have been listening so uh they announced their roster just the other day uh it is AA in-game leading then we have nedic which is kitten backwards when that when that dawned on me I was so surprised that neic is kitten backwards I never never thought that now you'll never be able to unsee it uh he's from New Zealand just want to make that clear he's not Australian same as addict who's also from New Zealand then the haza the last two I just said her from the bad news kangaroo ntic obviously from rooster and then MHL the opal with djl coaching um now I feel like I said gentleman I feel like I've spoken about it a lot but maybe maybe not where do do was I talking about it were you guys listening I mean you you referred to it a couple times and it was like very vague because you didn't know what to say because you know you're some in some way tied to the organization and to this team so we heard a little bits and pieces from you but nothing very concrete all right well my involvement is uh nothing in terms of like official involvement Talon reached out to me like late last year and they were wanting to get into Counter-Strike and I spoke to one of the owners Sean who did the YouTube video about the announcement and um they were just essentially they're interested in getting me on board right because they wanted to make a team within Australia the region uh but I was like ah like I I just want to kind of help give you some consultation really so they wanted to pay me and get me on in the organ stuff to in some role but that hasn't come to fruition and probably more on my end um than anything but I I don't think I have the time or the capacity to do that but I wanted to help give some advice in other words you're lazy yes well mate I had like a deal for worth like 80 grand go through the gurglar cuz I was too lazy to sign a [ __ ] contract just uh you know a couple months ago so that that's yeah really really yeah [ __ ] not good um but yeah so when they first on that and like I I'll take 50% you know just so you don't miss out on these on these opportunities yeah something like that but look when this first came around um there was obviously conversation about just potentially getting the Greyhound guys because they didn't have an org uh but went to go to go buy them and each of the players had like a pretty hefty buyout I think it was like 200 Grand or something right because at the time it was assumed that they were going to qualify for the major this is before they didn't qualify for the major um and then I said to the guys at talent I was like I don't think they're worth like 200 Grand a player like I wouldn't I wouldn't spend that that money I would just wait because they probably won't qualify for the major and then we can get them for free afterwards and then tried but they went with fly Quest and I think the reason they went with fly Quest is because as like part of my advisement with them was I said like if you want the team to actually compete I think you need um a European orer and maybe there would be like one other Personnel change that you can make or maybe try and bring in a European coach or something right so I think they as the Greyhound guys wanted to stay together which is I believe the reason that they went with fly Quest because fly Quest are letting them stay with that five um until the end of the year I think so Talent still wanted to be in the space um because they want to try and support Australian Counter-Strike because the owners are part Australian um and they were just asking to still put together a team and we just threw some names out there and and this is what go put together and they just spent the last two and a half weeks in Malta um just playing the the three that don't live in Europe will probably stay in Malta and Aaron went home and MHL went back to his home and they played today and they got dumpster so that's the story of talent did you did you see them in Malta at least well Aaron and I went well actually saw them all but Aaron and I went to the gym one day last week and then um I went back and checked out the house and that's it so yeah nice so you're an esport consultant now are you are you didn't get paid I did it for free like I was it was you know I've done it all for free is that is that a smart move I don't think so I I think I'm like those people usually those people are just for the money and you know it's like it doesn't matter if they actually have any influence yeah uh but like you know djl coaching and P is here how can how can you do it to the Man couldn't like put in a good word for p to to coach this team well look that's true I I didn't even think about that and what didn't come through my mind but pet what do you know about DJ that's a this this is better than you know me talking about what do you know about him what do you think about him as a coach um to be honest even though like he coached an IP and I also uh have been there I have not like heard that much about him uh in that regard like I I I know there was some talks I think ol of Meister was the one bringing that topic up like how did he get into ANP uh and I I think it was because he was good friend with humus uh it was more like a friendship between them and and he brought him in um apart from that to be honest like I have never I don't think I've ever been in any sort of like discussion with him or anything else okay so no overlap yeah I guess generationally you also got kind of missed missed out on each other like when you were mostly in the Swedish scene and like on Fanatics and IPS and stuff like that there was he came in much later than that so do you guys want to say anything about the talent team no feel like I just saw you know just like kind of like a response to to DJ's reputation feel like he's getting shafted quite a lot for what happened at nip and although I kind of understand that because he was there for kind of a long time through one of their worst periods ER we call it I was going to say like it's a lot of it was clearly not his decision making you know when it came to the roster and stuff like that so I feel like he's getting at the bad end of the stick bad end of the stick for for no none of his faults so I'm just a bit I feel like his reputation is kind of down in DOS for no reason at at the moment and I hope he can kind of recover it I don't want to say it's for no reason I feel like if you're a coach you have some responsibility even though even if you don't have all the responsibility it's kind of similar to the Zeus and liquid situation with this latest lineup where he said like he didn't pick the players he essentially just kind of got skulls in even though that was pretty much decided that they wanted him so but it's still he's still the coach right you either step down and say like this is [ __ ] I can't work like this or you make stuff happen you can't really because also if everything goes well then does he get you know if someone else picks the team and everything goes well does he get zero zero credit for it I think he would still get you know the positive credit but so some some negative credit has to go with it but I also think like obviously there's a lot of limiting factors not really that he he shouldn't get another chance in any way yeah so we'll see what happen with that with that team obviously they're going to try and qualify for the uh RMR for Asia and we'll we'll see how they go um I heard you guys I don't know if you can comment on this but I heard you guys were looking at ultimate first uh yeah so I this would have been through Aaron and DJ djl they they were like scouting and looking for aers um and they were in conversation with getting him but then uh from one day to the next he well not I think that he had been in conversations with liquid for a while um but yeah I think the offer was like officialized and then he told the talent guys that he had a had an offer so he went there they were in conversation with him if I was on in his spot I'd be like this liquid thing isn't real right it's not real so let's keep let's entertain all the options until it's like on my desk and signed make sure you've got the contract in the inbox first right yeah yeah so that that would have been through uh djl and Aza who were doing the The Scouting For looking for to fill that role um so yeah there you go Striker uh last bit of recent news it's not really another big one we can talk too much about but uh they played their debut game today uh it's the new tyo roster so they had Zing playing previously it's been rumored for some time if you you keep up with the dirt sheets on the forums of people talking about star to tyo uh but that move happened and star joins uh mosia Mercury jamy young and G from Lin Vision uh so those two are from Lin Vision G actually was there for a little bit of time now uh in the tyu roster and this roster is essentially just like a brand new generation of Chinese Counter-Strike it doesn't have like summer or somebody or any of those old names beaten around anymore it's it's a brand new generation even though we've seen a bunch of mercury and jamy young and Mia before and even the other guys from Lind Vision it's it's like the the next gen so uh I first glance this team looks like it has like a lot of Firepower but it's going to be the classic issue for China I think where the direction uh of how they approach the game is going to be the biggest the biggest drama um but probably gearing up for the major right guys I'd imagine Shanghai you want to do well you want to qualify you want to see if you can take down the Mongols it's going to be some some stiff competition in Asia I think yeah I would say so I mean this move is I mean it's kind of interesting that he would leave uh ly Vision because they they've been looking like the better team for for a while now but it's there's been a little bit of a shift towards tyo so I feel like they could be the the best Chinese team from now on and and they could be the ones to take the fight to to Mongols after these moves yeah they just lost a rare Adam the other day but that was before star uh was playing so yeah we'll have to see what happens there but another piece of news we're not going to spend too much time talking about cool yeah or great everyone's up to date that's awesome World Counter Strike Asia and ocean doing stuff that's that's good like it's good that tyu has a team that kind of makes sense you know they've been in a very weird like flux for forever so that's my like if we're doing the positive and negatives it's a team let's [ __ ] go it's a team all right nice there's the Highlight all right let's uh let's get into blast now uh pet you said you've been doing the the broadcast obviously on the Swedish side were you're doing the blast broadcast yeah so we're following um games of nip um okay yeah exclusively I think so yeah I'm not sure I mean I have I have nothing to do with that except for just commentating so uh but I think so yeah okay who are you commentating with anyone the people at home would know um maybe like if if people are super old a guy played semi semi-professional in at least he played in CS Source uh with some I I can't remember exactly which team it was but his nickname is RDL okay of course yeah he was in like godson coach like a while back like in 2016 with lro and that lineup right yeah yeah correct so he's the one doing the play byplay and I'm you know sitting there and trying to say something smart once in a while oh [ __ ] okay we got a former player transition to play by play that's kind of crazy yeah he's super good at it to be honest one thing that I have to just mention I think I don't understand how you guys especially you sponge like how you guys even manage to to like I do one3 commentate and I'm fully drained day I don't know how you like how you can manage so many games on broadcast week by week it's insane yeah I don't know I think we just hate oursel a lot right you know you get to that point where it's just like how how much can you put no but it's I think um when we have pretty good conditions when we're do an ESL event so it makes it makes pretty easy and they've given us this really nice like casting setup too so yeah the days go by pretty quick if anything in some of these events I've been like [ __ ] we've only done one game today what do I do for the next [ __ ] you know 20 hours because you only go in and you cast for like three and it's like like ewc we had these really big voids but like that's the thing if it's a really exciting game of Cs and you're locked in it can be like it yeah it can be pretty draining but it's it's sick fun that's the someone said cocaine uh no no no no uh only legal substances like caffeine okay uh so that means that you covered the nip well H look I guess we could we could start with nip why not why don't we start with a bit of a Swedish flavor and we can jump back to to liquid and go a little bit more in there because that's going to bleed into the cologne preview uh whereas nip aren't in Cologne right is that am I correct there yes I am correct you're correct so let's talk about I guess let's talk about the teams at blast who we're not going to see in Cologne and then we can start a bit of laap because that's going to play into some of our predictions so you said it at the start P Swedish Counterstrike hasn't been where it probably should be you know once once the kings of the castle uh through fanatic through nip SK gaming as well and this is obviously going back in time but you're looking at this new nip roster you've got three swedes in there you get yourself a bit of Isaac Maxa and of course re the 1972 Oakland Grand MVP Champion uh with a Ukrainian Ora and a Spanish ingame um but you know what did you make of it were were you were you happy were you pleasantly surprised was it what you expected um not at first uh the first lineup that they had but you know as as as the time went by I think like it was evident that there was some sort of IDE ideology uh with uh you know what threat was trying to build together with exist like it just it just felt like the roles like like there was a thought behind the roles uh with having Isaac in the team maxter being young coming in Rez obviously having a lot of experience uh and then I didn't know much about wrinkle when I first you know heard him uh joining nip obviously during my time with z00 nation I think we played him a couple of times so I did do some anti- strting against that guy um but apart from that I didn't know too much about him and and then obviously Alex know so when you when you mash all those players together it does make sense my only question regarding nip is like apart from the roles like do they have the players that are supposed to be able to step up uh when it really matters like is the quality there you know yeah like should they get someone who is right now I think like wrinkle has been playing really good apart from the last game yesterday against G2 I think he did like tremendously good uh but apart from him it's like who is supposed to step up like who is supposed to put up ni numbers uh once in a while like I don't expect them to have a NCO kind of player or you know donk kind of player but they need to have someone who could just go huge once in a while because otherwise I think there would just be in some sort of a limbo as maybe astralis is right now they will be around 10 15 uh but not not winning any titles so uh but you know the most positive thing just to some the nip topic I think the most positive thing is you know they have nailed the management uh side at least from my perspective you know they they have Eric vendel who is I think he worked previously with ESL yeah as a yeah as a talent manager and you know I think he's he's super smart uh humble guy and you know then obviously him being the head of talent and sorry the head of Esports uh maybe he doesn't have that too much in depth regarding Cs and then you know he has Threat by his side so I think there those two are really good Duo and that obviously exist who has been through it all both in 1.6 as a player and then in CSO and now most recently in CS2 as a coach so I think they have something really good going on I don't know if this lineup is the right one but I think nip can bring Swedish CS back even though we have to use a Spanish dude and a Ukrainian yeah I I'm curious like if you know obviously wrinkle is the real deal but you you wonder with nip if they stay at hovering around well if they can make into like top 15 top 10 and be that type of team right you wonder how long it is before they transition to back to full Swedish if this right now is just like a transitional thing obviously wrinkle like I said it's the the real deal when they brought in Alex they were leaning much more International but let's just sum up Group C right so they're in a group with was FaZe versus Cloud9 and G2 versus uh nip they were the openers uh they lost to G2 both times where they played them the opening and the group final but it was the wins Prof that could be getting people excited the be Club 921 but they beat phase two which is going to play a big part of our phase conversation a little bit later but them beating Cloud9 right like we we did the the 1X bet you know what are the odds yeah regarding Cloud9 last week and nip would have been the team that we you know if we were going to be saying that they were going to win a game it would be against nip right yeah I mean I think we all lean towards nip in that and mostly because it's a known quantity versus an unknown quantity you know we saw something from from nip before the break it wasn't like oh my God they're the best team in the world but like reaching final and in yala compass and then having like a semi I think in in Argentina in the fire league is that what the name of the tournament is it's like okay they're doing something huge difference to what where nip was like just a few months ago where they're just like a as we would uh say in creation just like a trash can to like kick around in the in the schoolyard like everyone just like just you just show up and you win kind of that that was kind of the state of nip uh so and we also saw a wrinkle I think that was that was a huge thing because you see that there is at least one guy here who has the star potential to to carry some of these games uh even if they're not the greatest you know not everything is going how it should be this guy can pull them through some weird rounds and I think that's what we saw in the in the Cloud9 game him getting hyped up the rest of the team like following I think we saw some from RE from from Isaac from you know maxter was having a pretty [ __ ] time and then The Phase game the on Inferno he was he was tough ragging I think I don't know if he ended up at the end of the game but he was for sure carrying them through the the biggest portion of that so I I don't know it's uh it's looking pretty decent not again I don't I don't put them in a top 10 category like maybe if they touch number 10 then that that's kind of where I see them peing right now but but compared to where they were this is a huge huge Improvement I you see some sort of a trajectory right because I mean maybe as P I will say you know in terms of um I I do think that they're still kind of a fire power problem right or kind of star power more like because it is basically wrinkle who they're kind of relying on to have some consistent black star performances and even he is kind of up and down and that's just through the style of a player he is like he's he's going for a lot of these plays that can be very risky and he has to do it if this team can compete against the better teams and sometimes take them down I mean we saw that in the face series he was just kind of running around doing what he wanted but you can't really rely on that as your sole fragging output right or at least to start like the the the big numbers that that you have to put up in a game sometimes to make the difference right so there's it seems like the like the the second third star of the team is is lacking at this point so maybe it is just the question of okay they will change one more player and that's what will get them to at least to the level of contention where they can do some deep runs maybe it's not going to be title winning lineup but at least they're going to be they're getting closer to that discussion even if they're not there at the moment so there's a lot of I mean there's there's a lot of positive signs even if uh you know at the moment we wouldn't put them anywhere near the discussion of of winning any titles I'm curious what you guys think about maxter because he was a lot quite a bit under Fire after the first few few games and is it just me or I feel like that's unreasonable like this is a guy that came from the academy team like two months ago of course I I don't expect him to be you know carrying the the team and this is his first big tournament against like tier one opposition um in my opinion feels makes sense to just give him more time I don't I don't know I feel like the the obsession in CS to talk about like player changes ah this guy needs to like we don't need to remove a player every month like that that doesn't really make a lot of sense so I don't know if I'm just uh on this boat right now I I don't have a very grasp of what his potential is right so this is where Chen could be a pretty good option as uh as the Swedish Counterstrike expert we have here Prof you've been dethroned I know you spent a lot of time in Sweden Prof but you you don't have the mantel this week so max P what do you think right because I I agree with what Striker saying uh you would think that it should be res and Maxa because Isaac's a supportive element and Alex is in-game leading so do you think he has the potential to to grow I really do um obviously like I think I think his biggest issue is I think he's had too like too high expectations of it on on himself going into this blast tournament like I even had to I don't know if I should mention it [ __ ] it but but like when I was doing the commentary like when we were watching maxter I I really felt bad for for him because I I know that he can play on a much higher level like even like even in screams on face it is like it's it's playing really good uh you could just see on his reaction like like body body reaction when he was dying in some weird scenarios or when he was not like hitting his shots like he was super frustrated and it was like it was so much more into um him like his way of playing uh so so I think that he needs like he needs a lot of help mentally um okay in terms of just you know getting the full trust like I don't mean makes sense by the way he said was also he needs mental health no yeah we yeah I think I think he's just putting like the bar too high that's what I'm trying to say and you know I I had to talk to him know I don't know if my advice is enough but you know if I if I could just tell him one thing which I also did was like just try to remember like how you died during all these rounds because you could see like him being spammed through the smoke a teammate missing a flashh like all these stuffs and and then you know he's just you know piling up I think it was like 0 and six or something in in in one of these games and you know when you're young you don't have that experience I think it's difficult to get back on track and I think that was one of the things that he has to you know just get better at uh I think nip should definitely try to to keep him uh and the question is as you guys mentioned I don't think Isaac is the one to be removed at all he's he's super good he's taking a lot of difficult positions uh he is a team player like through about uh the way he's playing the way he's entering the sites and all that stuff um and yeah so I think you know the biggest question mark is one of my favorite players that I ever worked with and that is re um and you know does he h have what it takes to be that you know X Factor alongside wrinkle because right now I think he's playing good when his teammates are playing good but he needs to be that guy who's playing good when his teammates are not playing good so he he needs to also work on the mental mental side of the game yeah yeah like it makes a lot of sense that re needs to especially be like considering the pedigree of what he can do and I feel like we've been saying that for a long time now but nip have been treading water for a long time now right so um but again and I like the point that you touched on there Prof because nip Once Upon a Time was an or team that we had Elite level expectations for but that hasn't been the case for a period of time now the same with fnatic which is really sad especially if you're a Swede or especially if you're an old school fan of the game because because those were two orgs that played a very big role I feel now that the elite level teams that we expect Elite level performances from are probably ones where you're like well why like they don't have time to bet in this player or for them to see if this works out over time would be your like your na'vi your vitalities your g2s uh liquid is another example FaZe is another example right they're the like upper echelon Elite teams that can't [ __ ] around they need to make the right decisions to make the Big Block B Buster choices where I think nip because of their poor performances have kind of bought themsel uh a little bit of leeway in that regard and they can start working back in so look the the runway would I imagine for them to try and qualify for the major and if they stay on the trajectory they're on right now that's very possible you know will they go deep in the major probably not but are they a team that could make it to the major with the type of performances that they're putting out yeah right and that's that's if I was nip from where I was that would probably be the goal so uh they have the rest of this season to try and work things out and yeah all good okay we got anything else want to say about nip gentlemen or we want to jump forward yeah let's go let's go to Cloud9 I guess yeah Cloud9 is a safe bet so uh obviously we discussed them losing to nip but this was the new roster on debut they also lost to uh well dra's team uh online um as well yes uh an augas team but so so they've been a little bit embattled to start out their their debut with with the roster um now their opening game actually felt like it was it was okay because they took a map off of FaZe and you're like oh [ __ ] like that that seems all right he's had some good moments from Icy axile against FaZe that old Trope um heavy God you know being quite handy and in in in moments I for some of the games I was a bit worried about inters but then they dropped down and they lost to to nip and then they were eliminated from the group stage right um so the initial taste for this team and this is another team because what was it around this time last year when the super team came together right the player break right yeah um the expectation for that roster was super high and now for Cloud9 it's very tempered like I don't even though it's a huge name in Esports I don't look at the new roster they put together and go yeah these guys need a win right now so I liked what I saw from the names that should be delivering IC axile and heavy gun so for me thumbs up you know it was all right I was I was okay they were they were a little round away from beating phase right I mean there was that like one situation that inter's got all the [ __ ] for basically on the B bump site that could have ended it all basically so they were they were hella close to actually getting that series that we said they probably wouldn't and even against the opponent we never actually expected they would um and obviously I mean that also says something about FaZe but I think you could see from from iy that he's legit I mean he definitely has the talent to be on the tier one um whether he's going to be able to do this consistently who knows but he has the peak he has he definitely has capability to play against these teams he he's generally more passive but he seems to understand when to go for for plays and and stuff like that he will overstep um every now and again but I was impressed with him especially and it seems as you were saying you know Exile is getting back to the level that we were kind of expecting him for and I wonder how much that is like a lot of people have been saying that it was kind of the inter combination that that unlocked him in the previous version of Cloud9 and maybe there's something to that I mean um they they play some of the sites together so uh it's been kind of fun to to see them back I mean uh I saw also a post about electronic and you know electon aile with electronic and flit with electronic and both of them without saw uh which was uh obviously sample size is not the biggest but you know it it is they're obviously kind of rifl that want to have some space do some do some plays and stuff like that and electronic as we know pretty vocal and has has his ideas about how to play the game and also wants to do a lot of things himself not just you know tell other people what to do which limits what other people can do so I mean I don't want to go in the whole VP thing uh but it is kind of looking like we we called it would be that some of the other rifl are not going to be that great uh not having as much fun as they did maybe previously uh before electronic but in terms of the cloud night thing I think yeah they looked pretty good um the heavy God was playing I I think more active than um he was an OG and like in previous teams where he was more like an anchoring position now he is more in rotations and like that's also interesting because in theory like axile heavy God enters are all players that like the like to Anchor as well as boage so technically they had like four side anchors on the teams even though like heavy got and axile obviously were the overqualified ones in these roles so they gave them a bit more freedom and it's working out pretty good I think the calling was pretty good from from bomit so overall they they're looking solid I think uh obviously kind of heartbreaking that they didn't get a single win between nip and FaZe when they're super close on both but I was also very happy just because of the hashtag one guy on Twitter that was calling me out with with a prediction but uh I don't want I don't want to be that guy and getting getting obsessed over one person but it did feel super good for to be correct let's let's just say oh it's always nice to be right man it's always nice to be right uh P your thoughts about Cloud9 you got anything do you think they're going to be a good team or same type of conversation we're having with nip you know they're probably hovering somewhere in the top 20 yeah I mean I I think b nine needs to I'm I'm really not sure about inter uh because I do get like a little bit of you know G2 Vibes with with Nexa I think with today today's meta uh when you you're having like your lurkers SL anchor they need to be you know they need to be a little bit scary for for the opponents because if you are an anchor on aside Mirage for an example and you know that you're going up against inter like with all due respect to him you're not that afraid in comparison let's say you're going up against robs you know against robs you're maybe holding the angle a little bit extra you're calling for a teammate to be close in rotation I don't think that's the case for for going up against inter and as you guys mentioned you know heavy God coming as a lurker but like when was in endpoint he was there like heavy lurk and then going over to OG and now uh into C9 he is more of like more active for me it would make more sense having axile and and heavy God being you know at the edges of the map uh while you're having boage IC and someone who is used to being very active like in the group uh I think that is like the next step for Cloud9 but at the same time like I I don't know what how the player Market looked for them and if was the best option they could go for uh because usually when we see at least I do but usually when I see all these big club like big Club names you're you're thinking oh C9 oh yeah they should be able to get like whoever they want basically but then you look at who is available and you're like what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is this you know the same like liquid hat with the oper like I I I I watched the show when you guys were talking about you know who who they should bring in as an oper and you went through the whole list of opers and I think it was was uh who was it lers he was like there's no operas available or something like that you know so so I think you know we don't know exactly what went through with C9 and if they just have settled for inters um as I said all all respect to him but but I think he he is they need to have someone with a scarier name if that makes any sense position yeah the way he played some of these rounds like beond Mirage or Beyond D two like the super pass uh over time it's just going to be easier for people to deal with uh I think I think if you're either side of the like super aggressive or super passive that's these are things that kind of get figured out quite quickly by other teams this is obviously the debut from the team so no one had any tape or you can know kind of how interest plays in general but if it's not the same team I don't think it's even worth kind of doing that research the way he played was like some of these rounds like the hiding on bench on Mirage or playing on The Big Box in the middle of dust two and just not peing when 99% of top players would kind of search for that timing when the when the player is PE peeking on you to peek on him right and not just stand there and wait for him to kind of uh kill you essentially because you're hiding behind a box and he can see you before you see him uh but but that's also kind of what Striker was saying that behavior helps other players be activated because you're saving a bit more time for them to rotate in you're supporting with the flash you're doing this and that so maybe for the start of the team it's not bad to have a player like inters who at least gives you a solid foundation even if he's not the the scariest player but I agree I think that that's I'm not super happy with what I saw even though I love inters always he's he's a cool guy it's a bit unfortunate I think that they and look position-wise I'm I I'm not in the nitty and the gritty but like a talent of somebody like magnes going to b boom like when all this stuff is happening with a team like Cloud9 right it's it's a bit of a shame for a Cloud9 that they miss a name like that who you know could could turn out to be something you know pretty good um all right well that's that's Cloud9 uh do we want to bother talking about the game of Legions and the ogs do we like gamer Legion had some moments I don't I I never really want to talk about OG the OG have never G leg I mean they're just fun they're just fun to watch and it's just such so much more of an interesting lineup than it was the previous version I don't mean the previous version the latest where they already had slend and and undo but I'm talking about the just the one just before that um and it's just they just have so many players that can do things like they anybody you look at like they will just have rounds where they just completely take over you know and it's just really fun to watch maybe it's not like 100% working together at the moment but they are very exciting team to watch even if uh you know they ended up losing both games against vitar they won the first MCH right I'm trying to remember that that match that was the one that I was watching pop enough yeah and it's uh it's just you can see that the B on youth is is working out I mean these guys are all really excited to play it seems like and uh and I really like that from a team um CTR was even having a lot of rounds on on Anubis and that win and and like all that stuff like it's it is just the team that I'm really excited to watch for the rest of the year and like early next year and I'm hoping you know this isn't like they don't get forgotten in these last few months just because they won't have so much to play compared to a lot of these teams and you know that's going to be important heading into 2025 when you have to have the ranking to get the invites and all that stuff so I just hope they get the opportunities they they deserve at the moment and uh and then carry that into 25 where you know these guys will get some experience and start doing something I have a I have a question for p why the [ __ ] did ZTR get kicked from metasport that makes no sense they're much worse now than they than they were before yeah I don't know how much I I I can tell you after this show uh okay with all the respect to because I know some of these guys and yeah uh but um from the out outside perspective I I I fully hear what you're were you're saying uh that was also my first you know my first thought when I heard that he was getting benched because it felt like they have had everything correct in that met sport lineup but I will tell you after so there is something that happened behind the scenes okay at least what I heard but okay all right okay all sorry guys you won't be hanging around for that one we will be though all right uh let's get into the overlap now I suppose because as I mentioned we're going to have themes or things that happen in blast that are going to directly impact the way we talk about Cologne so I think there's two I think there's three headlines there's probably more headlines but there's three that are in my head right now so how about we just go with those and we'll keep building on those headlines and we'll see what happens but uh let's let's pick our poison here go through them and and you guys can pick which one you want to start with heroic having issues getting dexster on site which is going to uh they had to play with s and they did beat complexity once which was kind of funny uh but they will have to start cologne uh with without Dexter and an unknown stand in Striker who's the unknown standin I can't say I heard the name but it seems to be it's not I heard it directly from the organization I told him I wouldn't share it so I can't say yet I will not comment on anything I will open it to complete speculation it is an OP I could say it is an oper at least I could say that so okay so they're trying to fill the role that's nice uh it's not yeah we were told it's not it's not saw and they they were able to submit somebody if somebody has uh has gotten a hold of the lineup they're probably going to be able to figure it out I don't actually have them so I don't know uh otherwise I would be able to share something because I would have it from a different Source than the actual organization but can't do it right now they've just shut down Prof they're on they on to us they they're to us guys they're on to us I'm here but for just my CH I what I what I will say it would be it would be a worthy replacement if if the name that I was told that would would come in they would they would be a realist like realistic like it won't make them so much worse than if they actually played with Dexter I would say I think it's a it's a good player okay all right has he has to be simple then right he's you simple hasn't played for year and something now anything I that's who I wanted it to be it's Forest wow yeah because he's he's an oper right because he's a primary oper yeah yeah uh look so so that was one like we can we can either delve into the heroic talk now if you want but that's the thing that's almost like a non-starter of a conversation purely because of that element right like Striker can actually say the most out of all of us without saying who the player is whereas the rest of us are in the [ __ ] dark we're like well who the [ __ ] knows who it's going to be it could be anybody they're going to they don't have their fifth they're going to do bad right then we've got obviously liquid on debut and then uh finally FaZe uh and the electric Baloo to their destined demise if they don't get their [ __ ] together suit so which one of the three do we want to kick off with let's go liquid all right liquid the most yeah the most to talk about there all right well uh look gentlemen I I want to get out the gates on the liquid one I want to make sure that I say this front and center because when we talk about this they're going to they're all going to they're going to get that biased [ __ ] paintbrush out guys and they're going to try and paint me they I'm not going to let them I'm not going to let them pain the voices in my head I'm not going to let them Paint Me Justin played mid to to paor I would say I will say that I think he played mid to PA okay and I think he would think he played bid to PA but fortunately twist and now are [ __ ] amazing Beast they are amazing like those has the [ __ ] out of me because he's the one who's been like he's always been Mr I can do everything and he's been moved around a billion times and somehow he's just he keeps doing it and he's like in the best form that I've seen him in a long time even now like it's it's insane how he keeps doing that obviously with Counter-Strike maths uh they beat the number one team in the world twice so that means that liquid are of course the number one team in the world number the the the context the context playing into this uh is is key of it being the the group stage um and there was still another opportunity for na'vi when we can talk about the na'vi stuff uh in the future but I guess we're just going to look at the positive signs that we saw from Team Liquid so P when you were watching Team Liquid and you saw this roster come together um what were you expecting like obviously this is a great result but if we put the results to one side and you look at the type of Counterstrike they were playing and what they were getting from the players what you what you take takeways I mean my first first takeaway when I heard that twists uh were supposed to be igl I I think I reacted as like 90% of the community I think it was I I think the call from him to transition into IG might be a bit too early in his career I think he is too good of a player uh you know having this having this thing about you know falling down individually uh because you're paying too much attention to what your team is doing what your teammates you know supposed to do during the round all this stuff I think uh it will take a hit on his individual level uh I don't think it did now during blasts uh but I think it will eventually do at least like if you look like doesn't have to do with my experience I think I think just throughout like CS history uh we've seen this so many times uh players thinking that they have the ability to to be in igel and you know it's all fun in the beginning but then all of a sudden you have to be you know first on team speak every morning you have to be you know prepared with at least an hour of talking and you know watching demos y y so so many things outside of the normal schedule of a top uh top player so I don't know you know I think it's more of a personal trait if if you're able to to have that uh because I think twist in his role I think he can manage to be a decent igl uh in that regard um but yeah I mean I think uh jkss and Naf I think they're just you know stable players in in their uh both position I think everyone on the team knows what he can expect them I think ultimate he had he had some good games I'm not going to lie I wasn't super fascinated you know throughout the whole uh whole um tournament uh but yet again he's he's basically coming out of nowhere at least from me like I have not heard that much about him and the fact that he can take that step into tier one and play that good as he did I think you know he has a bright future in front of him so all in all I think you know this team uh can become good but I think the biggest question is how how much will twist be able to you know withstand uh in this new role okay yeah yeah I I think like um the the twist question like with him playing as well as he did it's the longevity of it right because you're right we have seen other players of High Caliber take these positions before and maybe in the beginning when everything's going right it it sticks the I I look I can only take the guy at his word but I've spoken to twists like a decent amount in person and and the type of um like during the during the break I I you know I went out for dinner with him a couple of times and and and whatnot and heard what his plans were and the way he talks and thinks about the game and un fortunately for him no actually maybe fortunately for him he's got the same mental illness I do like of like only thinking about Counterstrike but he's not as mentally ill as me in terms of all the other facets The Voice he doesn't have the voices in his head so so he's got only the good stuff going on so like all the stuff that he talks about and the way he talks about it he just he makes like I'm a 35y old man he's 24 but he's a million times more mature in everything in the way that he talks and looks at all the things than I am so obviously again I can only Tak him at what he said and we'll have to see how that develops and that's going to be a big concern I think this type of Debut though with that success maybe it's you know maybe if they can continue moderate success because they did say didn't they he say an interview I think it's like a longterm thing they don't expect results straight away but then when you have results straight away then maybe you're thinking you should be doing better than you are and I I don't know I think overall I think it's just kind of like compensating for the start of the Year where obviously expectations were high from the beginning and like even if you know internally realized that they might take some time for them to to get on the same page there was always pressure from the outside so I guess they're just trying to compensate for that this time around you know so that they just don't get ahead of themselves early on you know because that's that's a trap that a lot of teams can get themselves into when they get a lot of big names and it's not always reasonable what play what people expect from the outside just because the names that you have on your team sometimes you know well I think another thing as well is we got always have to keep reminding oursel with these uh blast group stages that it is a group stage and that it's only partner or a teams as well so that all plays into it obviously cologne is going to be the the bigger test um their results even though they're good can't you kind have put the same behind them as you would like G2 with the Deep Run because of the type of format of the event for example but still early in the early in the season so that always plays in um it's also that like nobody ever saw them play before this right so like people have a week now to to catch up with what they're doing or maybe a few days before they play next so things will get harder from here people will like twist will have to get a next level to to his leadership right you know like call some fakes on what the Tendencies could be of the team and stuff like that it's that's always what happens after you know like let's say a month or two of the new team playing up like it it gets harder for them you know so even if it's obviously a good sign for them to be to be able to beat na'vi twice in two separate series you know it's it's it's not going to be easy from here to to keep that up no I I I think like with the ways they did it as well there was a lot of clutches uh in the first series that they played oh yeah and then obviously in the second time they played ultimate had that really big map out on uh Inferno but I was surprised that they won Anubis twice in a row I thought okay well now blade has a little bit of tape on them and I know Anubis is a bit of a sore spot for for na'vi um down for them yeah yeah that they should just be able to shut it out it's like well you know what they're doing now you know like you know the way that they're approaching the game or the positions etc etc so maybe they can just you know get it done but the fact like an na'vi actually seemed pretty disappointed with the loss and they were also being frustrated today of people watching their complexity game like you know they would just which is probably we shouldn't be here we we should have H the yeah finish this exactly but um I I think Prof like in terms of the best possible start for the roster you'd have to say this is it yeah I mean for sure I was actually um I was listening to a podcast with sis and automatic and I think that and Valance actually and they were talking a bit about like where you need to Peak as a team and like how you pace yourself you know how good do you want to be how fast and stuff like that and realistically you know there's so much in CS that you can learn as a team and develop and there's so much depth but realistically you need to be good as soon as possible you need to be good in the next two three months and if you're trying to do too much then you probably won't be good in the next three months and then you'll just change roster or people just you know hate each other to to to the the death of this of the team right and I think this is something that uh the liquid team is right now is doing super well in terms of their approach is so they're so not even aggressive but they're very combative I feel like they just want to go for trades they want to go for fights all the time and early on this is also something that is hard to predict and know what what's coming and you know maybe that is shortlived but that shortlived success is still success and it's better than [ __ ] losing and I really like the way they're playing and also I don't think it's easy to have this cohesion that they already have in terms of you know two guys are just going to run through a smoke and and trade on a on a guy where they need that space or they need you know need to clear one half of the map so they can rotate off and you know from A to B on Ancient or whatever and they will they're constantly going for these fights for a team that is really new like obviously two player changes but also some some you know positional changes new coach and this so I I was really impressed by the speed of decision making of everyone on the team you know across the board so I really I really like that I do think that's also something where they will be challenged now that people have seen how how they play and especially for cologne but it's a it's a really good starting point that that's my kind of takeaway from liquid well it seems like uh vertigo is going to be the Perma ban which is uh amazing love that yeah get that out of here uh but also by the way helped them against I mean the second time around as well even though they ended up getting destroyed on on Mirage any anyway you know they they B out nuke which by the way like na'vi have kind of slowly but surely this season seem to have made nuke their new whole map so that that's going to be interesting but but that's more of a side note um but well then marage and nuke are both pretty strong yeah yeah yeah but they they haven't lost nuke in like six games now in the new season so it's uh it seems like it's it's working out for them they probably put put a lot of focus on it during the break um I would imagine um what I was going to I mean if you we haven't spoken about ultimate too much yet so obviously I mean everybody remembers that first game like that was like the first impression we got got from him and from much more of their games it feels like that's kind of the case for him in general he just has a lot of moments where he's completely invisible and like there's a half where you won't notice him at all he's just you know silently getting killed here kill there but nothing like very flashy or anything like that and then he will have a great half out of nowhere where we'll just like have a lot of multi- kills you know go for a lot of plays and make them work you know we saw that against na'vi in the last map we saw that in the first map against verus Pro there was like one more that I can't remember which one it was I think it was one of the na'vi ones as well from the previous Series where he just had a really good half um so I feel like they don't need more from him I I don't think that he needs to be more than he what he's shown already for them to succeed as long as twist can keep up the the kind of number that he does obviously we were all kind of looking to him and to see if if he would drop off after this so far it hasn't been the case but as I said it's going to get harder he's going to have to focus more on on certain calls mid- rounds and stuff like that so t- sides are probably going to be more difficult uh from here on out but I mean skill-wise I mean he's insane he's he's still as much of Hedgehog machine as he's always been and and like nothing's taken away from him um so at least short term it seems like it's not affecting him and so if if he and Naf can keep this up P doesn't have to be some massive star he can just be a decent anchor and and like he doesn't have to be um the guy who's taking over games yakar is also seeming to be improved like obviously up and down he had a horrible Mirage against was it na'vi as well I think but he had a strong nbus for example other than that Mirage I mean he's been he's an entry obviously like he's he's in a lot of risky positions and sometimes it's going to work out sometimes not going to work out but overall he's definitely looking up compared to the previous version so overall I don't think I think it's kind of hard to poke holes in this liquid team in terms of Firepower you know it's not like you have a obvious weakness that you can look at and just say okay this is the guy will focus on or this is the gap where we can where we can find them you know it's it just seems like he he can ultimate can be uh kind of an xfactor oper and that's fine I don't think he needs to be more than what he's shown so far I think the only issues I really saw with ultimate they let him go for as many aggressive Peaks as he seemed to want on both sides which I think is fine and don't want to neuter a young or's like will to go for fights the last thing you want is an orer who becomes a [ __ ] and then you don't have that option to find those opening picks because they're too scared because you've told him off for giving away the opening death too many times or something right which is a fine line to to strike a balance of but sometimes when he was in these positions he would pick poor timings to start searching deeper and then he would get caught between like two angles and he just get shot in the side of the head and it was like bro why the [ __ ] did you do that I like we couldn't quite work it out but sometimes I saw that for the whole team I mean what prop was saying like that they're just compa as hell like they are contesting everything all the time it's like if they're in a position and they have somebody reasonably close to them they will just go and the other guy will actually follow them I mean prop is right there's a lot of cohesion there they are just fighting for all the space that they can and so I wonder if it's just kind of like a carrian type mindset you know where where twist is just taking a page out of phases book where they're like okay if you feel like you're you want to make a play just go for it and that that's that just seemed like the the game plan for them all tournament long you know where they were just all going for plays all the time um all right so this is what I want to do because otherwise we're going to be flip-flopping around and coming back and I understand that normally we're a little bit more structured with this of how we talk about events but I think because the conversation is more nuanced as opposed to like oh these guys are going to beat these guys we can dive in a little bit right now to to how we expect liquid to go in Cologne right they're going to start in the play-ins uh and they're going to go up against pain in the opening game and then they're going to play either furi or imperial in the followup if they win or if they lose uh so and now it's best of Threes the whole way so pet I'll throw it your way with everything we've spoken about here and um obviously your interest is can twist keep this up in the long term I guess fortunately this is the short term do you think what you saw from liquid the game is deep enough for them to to beat those teams and make it from the play-ins to the the main event um yeah considering the teams that they're going up against there is like I'm I'm a little bit worried if they get overconfident with the result that they just uh they had for blast because it's three b3s two games against uh na'vi and and one against uh uh VP right yeah so you know it's it's great and all you know uh but it's not it's all about not getting overconfident because as you guys also mentioned you know the the Peaks that they were just going for sometimes didn't make any sense you know I think overall their t- sides uh throughout the whole event didn't look that good except for Anubis which is also t- sided in some sense so you know their C sides were were the ones um know winning the the games uh now going into these teams it's it's a big question if if if they will be overconfident and you know being like a team you know Brazilian team just you know stomping them so you know we'll see but overall I think the start that they had at last I think it's good uh for them going coming into the next one yeah it's it's weird to call because pay are a team in their region who take care of business right like pay with big uzer always seemed pretty strong and then fura seemed improved uh as well over there in in ewc and now they've had more time I think they came back they're on the same plane as me coming back here to Malta to keep practicing in Europe and then Imperial obviously have the new edition of try so for the Brazilians this part of the bracket seems really [ __ ] juicy um but I feel that the class of the players across the board in liquid should be a determining Factor um like I'm not getting into the nitty and the gritty of the mpole too much but obviously we need to see them get tested on on more maps it feels like ancient and Anubis will maybe be their go-to their dust two didn't look so bad either but I would have out of the teams in the playin if liquid can play to the type of form that they did even if they lose their opponent's map pick that they should be able to grind out these victories with I I don't want to say they're they're individuals CU there was huge moments where like na had like you know and they bowed them out they bowed themselves out of these things so I I would have them making it through the play-ins um but yeah this is the thing it's so difficult to to make that call but I think I what I saw was enough from a team element and an individual element that if they fix the mistakes they only have what two days so one day will be a travel day one day will be a media day so to fix the issues and get the same page it's there's not a lot of time um yeah but I I still I still will back them in Prof what are you thinking I'm I'm on your like backing you back backing me okay all right yeah um I kind of agree like I don't see obviously anything is possible we don't have that much information on them and it's a different ball game being an underdog versus being a favorite I have to say just as a side note one of the things that kind of annoyed me about them beating na'vi uh especially the first time time how for some reason so many people wanted to phrase it as they beat the number one team in the world they beat the number one in the world because everyone it is technically correct but everyone doesn't really think of na'vi as the number one team in the world so when you just say they beat na'vi it doesn't sound that cool like oh they beat Faze or you know they beat Vitality it would sound cooler if they beat Spirit Ma's even but na'vi is number one but they're kind of not that cool so we'll just say they beat the number one team World raining major Champions yeah I mean I I just think it's a it's a kind of a fun little fun little thing that was a bit it was really like let's just frame this to make it sound as cool as possible but it was unnecessarily trying to to make it bigger than it was like it was it was a great result anyway that's what we do it's the entertainment business Prof that is true we're trying to make everything everything seem huge Striker uh would it be safe to assume that you think things are going in the way of liquid it all going to be good they can make it the play the group stage I would say so but I do agree that there's there's a lot of danger in that side of the bracket I mean there's also a lot of person I mean there's kind of a personal ble battle if they end up playing against FIA but even if it's Imperial you know it's not it's not a team to scoff at you know it's those guys have shown time again they can they can upset these big names every now and again you know so it's not an easy route through the to the main uh to the main event so I wouldn't wouldn't put it past them to to lose one of these games for sure okay so just I'll throw this out the room and then we'll move on to like phase or something along those lines but if we if we throw this into the room does any so we think that they have a decent chance to make it from the play to the group stage is there any expectation past that into the main tournament you mean yeah to the like could they make it to the playoffs because obviously this is the problem with talking about it with this type of format we don't even know which group they're going to get placed in so we can't even measure it right against are they going to be in cuz one side of like group a I think group a has G2 na'vi spirit and astralis whereas group rough man yeah it is where has pH Vitality Mouse and VP yes VP and three of those names have some I mean we can we can kind of get into that discussion right like I mean I think all of us would probably agree that in group eight there would be up against the ropes I mean it's it seems hard for it's it looks hard for them to to beat like let's say two of you know those four teams let's say or three teams even obviously they've already beaten Navi but both of them were very close I mean third time around nobody's nobody knows how that's going to go asral have looked pretty strong G2 obviously Spirits you know the the angle that I was going to to go with is I think there's a reasonable chance also because I don't think there's anybody who's particularly dominant at this point I mean we're heading into colone with like seven eight names that could potentially win it and a lot of it is also because there's been weaknesses I mean even if you look at Spirit we'll talk about them later but I think you know they've they've shown a lot of weakness in the groups I think they are kind of I don't know I was looking at their last series against the complexity and I mean they were very likely to lose that even at at certain points you know if it wasn't for like the 1 V2 from from shirou and stuff so there's none of these top teams look like they're in Tournament winning like faor or anything like that nobody's stable at the moment so I mean why wouldn't liquid be able to beat two of these names you know like if they if they meet the right matchups you know I don't see that there's a I don't think there would be a crazy thing to say that for them to make playoffs yeah I think for me I just ER on the side of caution with this type of stuff right I I I'll go okay honeymoon context to start of season haven't seen them go uh like I think that the capacity is there right the but and and when you talk about the field in that fashion sure uh but and I I also guess it can work both ways in the sense that it is the start of the season and that these like the way G2 ran it to the final uh in ewc so anything could be possible if the teams have a high enough caliber of player which I think liquid does and a strong enough understanding of how they want to play the game as a team um so yeah I guess I can see it from both sides um I just want the voices in my head to stay quiet so I won't I won't go one way as opposed to the other um all right let's let's shift a gear let's get into something that is concerning and concerning because not only do the results make it look that way but so do their tweets uh FaZe they are flailing right now uh the the big stage Trope of this team doing well at the big events and you know being a stage team I feel that that shine is starting to wear off obviously this was just a group stage but as we look at the tail end of last season and we look at this team now struggling to get it together and then also after the losses they lost to nip but uh then they came out on Twitter a bunch of them like robs carrian and Frozen the tweets we're not like ah it's just a group stage who cares like colog around the corner let's [ __ ] smash this is where we do our best work it was one where it feels like there is true concern within the camp so gentlemen is FaZe on the downward slide or can they pick thems up dusts off and uh pull it together for for cologne what do we think was taking it no one wants to jump on the landmine because we all just want to say yeah it's FaZe of course they can turn it around of course can I've kind of lost hope to be honest okay now it's concerning everywhere and the problem is like I haven't even made an opinion about why like what's what it is that that why did they suck all of a sudden like I have a hard time identifying it for like the last three months or whatever since they stopped um contending for these deep runs you know and it's it's just very baffling because I think a lot of people will be understandably looking at robs first of all but at the same time like these issues aren't coming from him especially just because there are a lot of situations where he just doesn't have anything to do from the positions that he is in a lot of the time on tside like of course if you're looking and unless you're particularly aggressive you're not going to be able to get into situations where you can win rounds on your own you know you're going to be left in 1 v3s or to e4s saving or just in situations where you're very unlikely to end around so even if obviously if he was playing better there would be situation he would be able to get them into situations where they can win more more rounds so it's obviously it's a part of it but I don't think he's like suddenly the only problem that they just change lurkers and like somebody who's just better in those positions and they'll suddenly um start beating everybody you know I don't think that's that's the singular issue but I don't know what else to point at at the moment you know it's tough it is I mean someone actually in chat me mentioned that their like tside trading was the worst uh out of all teams in Blast but their tside win rate was the worst out of all teams in blast and that's like with OG being there you know with with the igl standing how is that how's that even possible with uh with these players that uh that they have I honestly I I felt inverse of liquid in terms of like the team cohesion felt very bad and some of these 2v2 1 V2s some of the some of the stuff that's not super technical Counterstrike where you can sometimes fault phase for being simplistic but also have to accept that that's their style um if you're playing a 2v2 and you don't play well off of each other there's no excuse for that uh especially for FaZe I feel like that's always been their their Forte and also it's not like they made some huge changes on a team recently even the Frozen thing coming in that's also a player that has a lot of cohesion with players that are already there and it's one guy and that's been not months since since that happened right so I'm I'm just confused when I see some of the rounds that they lose honestly um that that's that's been very uh worrying for me okay yeah Peta do you do you have anything you know with FaZe that's worrying you cuz right now I feel like we're all we're in like Alcoholics Anonymous and all sitting around and we're talking about these deep dark fears that we shouldn't be talking about yeah I think you know while you guys were talking I was trying to you know remember because I did cover that game against nip uh and I one of the things that I I I think we're lacking from face is you know having more of these at least on the T side where they're just working off each other way better because I feel like as you also mentioned like they're playing a very loose kind of Cs and the loose kind of C is it's all up to you know hitting your shots and obviously they have some really skilled players but once those shots are not Landing then you know the rounds are just fall falling apart so they need to be able to you know maybe shift a little away a little bit from The Meta that they have been using for for quite a while and you know being able to adapt so when the players are not hitting the shots then the team needs to hit the shot together if makes any sense uh and you know I think also what carrian uh mentioned during the interview I think this was the pregame or postgame I can't remember exactly uh when it was but it was with the nip game and he mentioned that they have been focusing a little bit more on you know the bad things that they're doing instead of you know positives and I think this is you know the biggest issue at least what I've experienced as a coach you know it's so easy to find issues that that the team is doing like you can watch any team and you can just find you know issues every every second round and when you're just focusing on them you know you know you're building that tension up uh towards those players and at the end they're just feeling like they're doing everything wrong all the time and just overthink thinking situations instead of just going with intuition so I think what K said was they need to start looking more at the positives I think that's that's something that they need to do obviously doesn't sound that easy to do but they just need to get some wins up and you know get that positive uh but I think the easiest fix for them would just be you know to to work at least have some rounds where you can just fall back on uh as a team uh get some more structure into that team uh yeah yeah I want do you think like this is pure speculation because it's so hard unless we're talking to the players we hear things right and and uh I'm not in that position I don't I don't know anything with this I'm kind of just talking out of my ass right now but it feels like if they continue going in the way they're going and maybe it's already starting to creep in as a bit of like discontent you know whether that's with each other whether that's the way they're approaching the game they went from being in all those finals they obviously one chunk do to then the tail end of the season and the I don't want to say the excuse right but the the rationale was or we're burnt out which is fair because they were going deep in so many tournaments right they were going all the way and you're playing more matches and then uh you know you're trying to stay on top of your game because you are going deep so you're still a massive threat and then going into the break it's like yeah they just need some some RNR and then they'll come out the other side and everything should be all right but the first two looks haven't been great and then the concern because I always want to make sure I say this every single time because people miss it we're always talking about this with the context of start of the season and newer teams like for some of them like for NP that's more like the Super Bowl with them getting that result whereas for FaZe like it's important for them to get that result because they don't want to have to play The Showdown but it's not as important right like we're just the way that we're measuring these things but then the tweets come out and then it feels like it is really important for FaZe with them losing those games so I think it's more that's that's probably I mean obviously it's important for them to qualify for for those big events right and and not have to go through The Showdown but it's also I'm sure the the pressure is just mounting internally as well and they're they're just probably confus just as confused as everybody is like as to why they they keep losing and they don't have the same level as they as they did before even on the individuals and so I don't think it necessarily has to do with the with the tournament result or like what tournament they're playing in but just just not winning like it's they just keep losing in situations where they don't understand why this is a bad time to be having an identity crisis though they did not have a boot G from what I noted in the interview so will that happen maybe now before cologne because this is all kind of part of the let's not get burnt out let's PE you know let's aim for cologne maybe aim for the major I don't know how they prioritize obviously every team is going to do it differently but it seems like this is now their ramp up period of like intense ramp up period but you can't really uh ignore just the the aspect of winning and being in form you know that's that's something that that's very hard to quantify and uh it's hard to get back as both of you you and and Peta were were talking about it's a it's a tricky position that they're in now that doesn't mean that just going for a boot camp of a week will solve their problems because they feel that they are so deep in the hole right now and that they need to maybe overcompensate and change things that are they don't need to be changed but you know they need to do 20% they're going to do 50 and they're going to like disturb something else in this whole process so it's a I think it's a very I don't think it can be overlooked just because it's blast group stage when you get okay too old by by ni IP I don't think you can be like ah this doesn't matter um you know obviously if they you know lose to G2 in a close game in the final in the final match and then maybe sneak by you know a complexity in the in the in the playoff and you know ah it it wasn't great it wasn't pretty but they got through that would be the phase that we can be like oh it's okay but I don't think this is okay and that's why kind of the tweets come out because at the end of the day you can prioritize tournaments but when you lose it it feels [ __ ] okay so would a fair summary be they're on a a downward Trend but there is a the pH chance that they bounce back colog for me it's a I think cologne is a big I don't want to say make or break maybe that's just slightly too far but it is going to be a um a big test to see what isn't the type of Team we'd see change roster before the major right like things things aren't that level of bad I don't even know how they can do that so right so like that that's not even a conversation worth starting but the the signs are are definitely pointing down but at this event based on what you know you mentioned before Striker there's quite a large field of teams that could win phase would still remain in that category if they play like FaZe can play like the team at the start of the Season as both at this point we probably all put them at the bottom of that list though um with with what we've seen about last couple of tournaments I just got to add regarding face I think now it's the perfect time you know to see know what the coach can do because we're us often you know asking what kind of influence does a coach have within a CST I think now it's the perfect time to see exactly you know what news you know up to but also the people around him I don't know how many uh coaches he has around him also but you know obviously if you have this team you know that you have been good if you can turn it around you know I think that's all credit you know to the coach so now it's the right time you just see exactly how much influence does a coach have in CS okay yeah I I think one of the things when we tend to look at phases we put a lot of the Strategic side uh obviously on carrian right but then we hear that a lot of these time out that are taken into like half by rounds it's like Neo's strats that they're running or suggestions that they're running with and then you piece that together with how raban used to be for this team which was quite a big influence on the the social side when he when he was there so I guess it's going to be a combination of all of those different parts because to to me they were always when raban was there and they were doing those boot camps you would always see like silly tweets coming out of phase like they were they were doing stupid stuff and like um maybe they're just missing a little bit of that which is so so it feels so reductive to be like oh they have more fun it is very reductive just because like everybody who wins who's in a winning position is going to have more fun like they're just always going to joke around there's not going to be so much pressure on the situation because they know though they're good now they're know they're not so it's exactly the opposite right it's not like just like just have more fun like obviously you can't just say that to a team who's like lost lost so many games like important games and like in ways that they can't even explain to themselves you know properly all right well we're on watch for phase yeah quick break and then we continue yeah I just wanted to I just wanted to add like the the last like four tournaments from FaZe because I just wanted to go back through to to to check what teams they lost to right and so from groups East Sports World Cup spring final and Dallas so the teams they beat were M80 VP which is the VP that were still Fresh Off electronic at the time yeah saw fly Quest and now Cloud9 are the only teams they beat in last four tournaments and teams they lost to are nip G2 na'vi twice Vitality G2 Spirit none of the top teams that they played against they beat like every time they've played a top team since pro league they've lost so up until this point they had been fending off anybody essentially basically anybody ranked below them they beat but nobody ranked rank around or above yeah exactly okay oh yeah IP sorry yeah right yeah but that's a all right well that's that is well it's already caused for concern but that's adding a bit more framing to that all right Lucas run the out break we'll be right back we'll keep talking about all things uh well blast teams and what do expecting cologne the world is changing quickly clear sh the world is changing but One Thing Remains the Same victories with WX bet since the dawn of Cs go we have been there observers of all that competition can reveal Elation fear Triumph and heartache reach out from every frame from the small Studios and conference rooms to the Epic arenas the feeling is still the same we live and breathe this game this was csgo through the lens by now at hltv.org we're back and all of you in chat have been spamming maybe not all of you I shouldn't say all of you some of you in chat have been coming in here to tell us that Joel has been banned uh by the the the across anti-che uh so we will do a quick little bid on this now I I don't know why news that's breaking live I guess they just want our reaction to be like man I always now but oh no but I have been actually getting some info on this as as we were going along um maybe that's some people noticed I got a little bit sidelined um so yeah I've been trying to I've been trying to figure out what's going on we know what is it like the heroic can't tell us at the moment uh the to I I got in touch with the to and the to told me that they validated the ban with with acros so it does they say they don't have a reason to believe it's a false positive but they are being careful just because it's obvious a new situation so they they don't want to say anything absolute that's CCC by the way everybody yes exactly um so he did get banned by acus and acus apparently confirmed this ban like that that it really happened it wasn't just some some false message or anything like that don't they don't believe it's a false positive so that's obviously in some way damning but we don't know how like for what what what it could have been because I don't know exactly what this anti could could technically ban for you know like is it does it have to be a wall hack or an aot or could it be just some like off file in the in the PC or whatever it is you know like I don't know this handti sheet uh to to good enough degree to to to say what it could have been that he got banned for because that's I didn't get that information okay P what's your uh take on the most controversial figure in Swedish Counter-Strike Joel yeah um yeah maybe maybe I'm not the right person to ask considering of also you know with the coach bug and all that stuff so trying to you know I mean you know throw what do you say throw stones in the glass house yeah those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones yeah I mean I think you got caught a few times less than uh in few you got involved in few less cont controversies controversies controversy both way let's just say that um I don't know it's it's a it's a great um great little CV that he's building for himself you know um at the same time when uh across the [ __ ] then people say this is a [ __ ] anticheat it's it's useless but now that Joel gets banned it's the best in the world and we should instantly trust it 100% and never like double double guess it or anything like that so I I I guess it is important to mention that he plays for this new uh BC gaming team right is the with um Guardians coaching that BC game not gaming sorry gotta make sure I get that one right uh with anas sanito lcro and Prime Taps and as I mentioned Guardian coaching that roster um and he has been their highest rated player but that's the thing with Joel he always seems to be putting up good numbers right but he's been know yeah you're reading the forums that Joel the scammer or he's a cheater or there's obviously the whole e case that um in like there was a lot of allegations that uh of cheating they didn't actually find any any conclusive evidence of that but he they did find some betting offenses that he bet on his his own team and and stuff like that in other matches as well from from what I recall so obviously there's been rumors like this flying around him even if nothing's been strictly speaking proven so that's that's just worth um adding for context even if it doesn't necessarily prove anything yeah I mean I mean there's been so many rumors within Swedish Pro scene like at Le at least the players on his level uh who are like like confident that he he has been cheating so uh but that that's mostly rumors like every time at at least some of these Swedish players I think there was someone from the Swedish team Alliance who you know tweeted something you know every time when they lost against them or whatever you know it's just like yeah whatever yeah I mean I see I see all the Johnny speeds guys and like everybody who's ever played against him is coming out of the uh yeah coming out of everywhere yeah you know I was supposed to coach him actually in in godsent oh [ __ ] okay yeah but but then I I got the information from people that knew him better and uh yeah I think that's you DOD that but yeah eventually leted me you know not taking that that offer I think like some of these teams like I think godson wasn't he was on gunet for for for a while right and uh I think they got blacklisted by a lot of um online tournaments which kind of made all of his teammates lose out on opportunities even after he left they just refused to to play with the team or invite the team to tournaments which obviously is a reason to be to be pissed about that I think it's just it's crazy I know people give like second and third chances to players that perform but the amount of chances this guy is getting and the pace at which it proves not to be a good idea it's it's insane the combination of that two is insane to me that's it yeah all right well yeah Lucas you're more than welcome to say something what would you like to say so um from like a tournament organizer perspective as a guy who's been using AOS for years for like tournaments oh here we go my feeling or of the product is um like a lot of people say it's [ __ ] and I think it's definitely gotten a Vibe where the user experience of using it was [ __ ] because it's a small uh like a smaller team working on it than for example face hit or you know some big anti-che um but the the important part is that there aren't a lot of these third party anti-cheats out there on the market and if you don't want to be forced to use face it servers and only have the technologies that face it can provide or find another platform like uh you know esportal or um Gamers Club you you're kind of forced to use these options or not use AOS and then you don't have an anti-che and people would complain um but having a lot of conversation with aost the tech behind it is solid like the detections they they know what they do they just had a lot of like growing pains and like startup and um so they've got a bad rep but if acos say they have the data that someone got banned for cheating I would trust them because the like technology behind acoss is solid so just to add a question to this a question to this is uh how many false positive bands have you received through like all of the like dust two leagues that that exist I've never had a false positive uh ban I've had a lot of uh uh like people randomly getting kicked mid game because like some server lost connection or you know and that's what I mean about growing pains like growing from a you know a 100 players doing something and then a thousand and then 10,000 then you know doing Majors qualifiers it's not easy and if you're you know a small team and one of the only products out there and you get you know the attention for it it can be rough uh but but it looks like you know they're they're doing a good job and I think it's important that we have these products on the market like anti-che is important look at the state of Counter Strike of course we need anticheat apparently um and what about easy anti Che Lucas so easy antiche dropped their Counter-Strike support oh they ared like cheat too good try to go out and find like thirdparty anti-cheats for Counter Strike and it's rough yeah no of course all right let's bring back cheating death I think only pit and I might be remembering cheating death from 1.5 oh no I wasn't around [ __ ] I'm too old I'm too old [ __ ] all right uh let's let's get back let's get back on track so we've derailed guys the Train's fallen off there's an explosion we've derailed we've left the Joel's train we're back on the regular train I don't know how that would work apparently my train tomorrow is going to take two and a half hours anyway enough about trains uh more about Counterstrike so let's pick another name from the blast groups that we were like because I think Striker you pointed this out maybe we can boil this down yep because this is quite important you said maybe you know seven or eight teams who could win this event would I be safe in assuming those seven or eight teams include na'vi Spirit Mouse Vitality G2 phase that's only six I would say you can say it's kind of a it's a stretch at this point just because they haven't really gotten to that point but I think as are somewhere in that discussion as well with the right Journey you know um but of course I mean that's more of a that's more of a su subjective opinion that some than than something that actually is based in results because obviously we all know they've been struggling to to get past a certain level and they haven't actually beaten a lot of the big teams so far so now they would there would be somewhere on the edge of that I would say rather than like an outright one of the f one of the let's say six favorites you mentioned you know okay is there any agreement or disagreement with what Striker just put out here like asaly said it's the subjective one but with the others that I mentioned right na'vi Spirit M Vitality G2 phase are you Prof pet are you do you guys in agreement that these are the teams who are in the running for the title I leave the guest to go first is there anyone here that you don't think can win yeah I don't know I'm not sure about austr to be honest okay I like that I think I think they're also on you know on the same same hype train as as liquid you know trans transitioning a a superstar into an igl uh you know I I think they can you know win some games and and bring bring some good results uh but I don't see them as a title Contender not yet at least uh I feel like their play style is is very how to say it everyone is going for a du basically okay at least you know how I feel like and uh yeah I mean I don't know how much time and effort device is putting into the igl role you know it's it's one thing just calling a strat in the game but it's you know a different thing prepping stuff uh and um and all those things so I think they need some more more stuff in their playbook before I will put them as a title Contender uh yeah I haven't been hugely impressed with aalis if anything I was on back to trains I was on the hype train early for Australis I thought that this was this could work right and I think you know the blend of players that they had but I think the approach to some of the maps they're strong right but I think their their weakness becomes when you start to get deeper and deeper into that map Pool it starts to look weaker and weaker um the way that they were able to play on nuke in the early stages where they were doing those like top takes where they had the double layers of utility but there doesn't feel like there's more depth to their game or they're not able to play out like chessboard mid rounds but if they go on Ancient I'm like yeah okay like I think aalis could beat anyone in the world on Ancient I think they're a good ancient team but uh and I liked some of the moves that they were doing on Dust 2 for example when I saw them playing within the scrip like yeah there's a couple of nice ideas here like even know they lost that overtime game to Falcons for example but I still think you know they could be quite a good team on that on that map um so against the elite is where it can be a little bit more concerning I'm glad that they picked vertigo when they played against um Vitality the second time because device had said something in an interview at the early stages of blast where he was like oh at the tail end of last season we couldn't play a lot of vertigo and then they didn't pick it and I was like well I took from your interview that you probably wanted to play vertigo and then you could have played it against vitality and then you didn't so I think hopefully that's a map that they can Flex in certain matchups but when you're going to verse against some of the best teams some of them don't really play Vero right so you you might not be able to get those matchups so I think that they're lacking as well I wouldn't put them in the same category as the other six I think that'd be like as you said St you have phase down the bottom I would I would have AAS outside of that group because I think if FaZe play their absolute best CS some somehow they pull it out of their ass like I'm not predicting that they will I don't think asales can match that right so I would I would have asales detached um from that conversation but then at the same time it seems a bit Rich that I'm putting G2 in that conversation when we've only seen them play you know two events worth with the new roster but it does feel like there's a lot of potential with how this new team is is kind of come together now Prof do you want to put a cap on the Australis note do you have anything you want I'll be very short and I'll I'll just say that I feel like they have pretty much plateaued after their early early development with this fiveman core I don't really see any any new progress from the team okay all right fair enough uh let's jump into the G2 conversation because we just mentioned it there and I think they're a fun one now P the tweet that you made and I I don't have it up so I'm not going to be quoting it for btim here by any stretch but you were basically talking about the lifespan of this roster and and how you foresee it going and uh the key takeaways in the early stages you think it's going to be pretty good or it can find success which I would say it's already living up to to that expectation uh maybe even slightly exceeding that's still only a group stage and a tournament's worth but then essentially over time when the Growing Pains come in uh and the longevity of the roster that it that it would taper out is that a fair smise of the general gist of the the Tweet yeah yeah so do you want to get into to why you think that a little bit more and do you think that the positive signs of G2 like is enough in a tournament like this for them to because they have the reigning Champion core of cologne playing so that's that's something they've got going for them yeah I mean we're talking a lot about you know roles within Cs and and all these things one of the key takeaways uh regarding that tweet is you know in the beginning honeymoon period obviously but I think a lot of their a lot of the problem problems that they are facing right now you know how to adapt to a specific round or how to react everything is coming from you know experience so I think their most recent experience is coming from hookie at least from this three man core uh you know how to deal with specific scenarios obviously snacks comes in with some of his and then Mals uh if if any I don't know how much you know uh space he's taking on the TeamSpeak server when they're going through stuff but uh you know in the beginning they're just you know applying the copy paste some you know uh uh problem solving into into the way they're playing uh as time passes you know what I meant with my tweet but as as time passes they're slowly moving away from you know the experience solving into let's solve it as a team and I think you know when you looking at that team I don't know how they will be able to solve it uh in terms of you know role wise uh because I think uh you know Mony Nico and Hunter you know they make sense but it doesn't make any sense you know Mals at you know at least for me it doesn't make any sense uh him playing in the position that he's playing uh the same goes you know for any igl uh like twist that we already talk about you know once time is is going by and you're not getting that attention on the server as you're used to then you start slowly you know dreaming back to those old good days when you're playing in those good positions you know uh which will lead to maybe him playing more for himself rather than the team uh and I I think that's where the frustration might Mount up and that's when they have to you know as a collective try to solve those issues and I don't know if they will be able to solve those issues um you know so right now they're just using previous experience as a team to solve problems uh but I think in a month or two that's when they will as a team have to solve the issues collectively and uh uh yeah I mean yeah obviously they have have a pretty good start not going to lie you know I didn't expect them to play that good as they have done uh but I think the biggest test for them will be by the end of this year on the major and uh yeah if I if I were to just sum this all up so I'm not talking too long but I think you know if if they don't make a good run on the major I think this is you know somewhat a um how do you say it uh nail in the coffin no when you yeah yeah yeah yeah I I think that I think like what I'm taking from what you're saying here is or at least my interpretation like and I I I never know how to paint coaches it's really difficult because we don't know unless the players talk about what they contribute right but in terms of like the big brains I'm not looking at Taz like I'm looking at uh blade for example right like the way that they solve problems at na'vi is going to be through an understanding of Blade and Alexi um whereas that that could still exist for the likes of Taz and snacks but I don't look at them tactically in the same way as I would the other the other two right so where's that contribution going to come from within the team and I think G2 are the type of team who would solve problem s and I don't mean personally well maybe personally but a bit of blunt force trauma right like you know oh well we just got to [ __ ] shoot him in the head harder boys you know like you know we got like as as silly as that kind of sounds that and they also if you look at the moves that have happened within this team they once once a rift or a problem seems like okay well this is a problem uh the way we fix this is we change something right like that's if you that's the way it seems to go with them they haven't been able to like find a second or be able to to push through those things so yeah if if it does dry up and they don't they if they this is the thing I think Prof with what you touched on earlier when you were referencing the the valance and seus um uh conversation that was being had uh like if if they can have like a lot of success early like we're talking deep runs or even maybe winning one of these trophies early within the season then that's going to that'll continue to give them the legs like the longevity it's only when the bad results come that then the cracks will start to form but with the the form that they have right now and the way that they're shooting and with it being so early in the season what are we talking about we're talking about maybe how many Maps would they have played as a team at the at the moment like and that goes for maybe that seems like a lot that 20 seems like a lot I'm having a look right now I would say what 12 oh no wait they went to the finals of 17 okay so we're somewhere somewhere in the middle 17 maps they have uh we know they banned we know they banned vertigo they got tested somebody picked a Anubis against right so they had to play Anubis they've only played nuke uh what they played nuke three times they played Mirage twice dust two once and Anubis once and then at the top end of the map Pool one of their go-tos is ancient and they also are playing Inferno even though they've addressed that hey it might not be as strong as it once was but they played that four times so we're talking 17 maps over two map two events worth of Counterstrike they already get to be straight within the the group stage so they don't have to worry about the playin you win two best of Threes so there's potentially just another maps and you're already locked in for the arena think about how little like right now exploiting Tendencies and stuff if you look at the ancient that's one of the only Maps where you're going to be able to sit there and go yeah they do these things all the time and even there they're doing stuff that's like seems spawn based like the amount of times I see snacks in aain aggressive with [ __ ] Mony I'm like the [ __ ] going on here like what's this [ __ ] doing over here like why is he not like some so their setups at the moment it still feels creative it still feels like they're trying new things and they're they're not in they're not like an old married couple who know okay we wake up at this time we go for the walk we have dinner at this like they're still trying new things and there's a bit that spark so for cologne they're in a really good spot because they're hot everyone's shooting like Nico's playing well Hunter's finding impact Ms is having his moments snacks is having these crazy plays Mony um is you know this is the other thing we talk about players oh they're not always oh this guy had a [ __ ] game he's not consistence like when everyone in your team is shooting hard guys there's only so many kills to go around like you know it's not it's not always going to be just the one or two guys getting all those frags so I think for G2 in Cologne they have a they have a good shot there's a there's a case to be made based off their form starting the season I I think they like I don't I don't think that'd be my favorite but there's there's a case to be made for them so um Prof Striker anyone want to pick up the G their um ratio of in how inform they are versus how new they are is pretty good like in terms of their still somewhat the mystery of how they're playing but individually they're playing pretty well they have enough experience enough wins behind them to have the confidence at the same time so that's why I I get the I get the hype not the hype but the what you're explaining as a possibility for them to make a Deep Run in this kind of uh influx state that we have right now in CS where there's not really too many obvious choices uh I definitely think there's there's a chance for them to to take a w right here if my light stays on but we'll have more also like we were talking about Mony at the ewc because um he was he didn't have his best tournament ever uh but now he was uh the highest rated player at at blast so bounce back don don as well was up there so he also had some insane rounds and games overall so yeah it's uh it's back on for sure if they have Mony playing like that and the rest of the team is also inform formed I I do think um it's kind of a crazy combination but it's somehow working in in the short term but it's definitely going to be an interesting interesting case study to see when they hit the wall eventually how they how they address it yeah yeah okay so we've touched on G2 phase liquid uh there's we spoke about stalis did you want to say something there Peta it seemed like you wanted to say um yeah I mean the only thing that I wanted cash yeah the only thing that I wanted to add I was not sure if I should say it but uh at least from my experience as a coach you know when you're a fresh new team you're never making any mistakes you know you're just focusing on doing new stuff and if someone is over peaking whatever you know but as soon as you start losing that's when you start addressing these over Peaks and you know you should play smarter in this scenario blah blah blah blah blah and I think once G2 hits that wall when they when they come to that scenario that's when I'm afraid you know if they will be able able to pick it up and you know actually develop because G2 recently at least in comparison to G2 with hookie I think you know they're going for so many recks sometimes not even you know just playing the the scenario you know after plant maybe just you know plug out the keyboard go AFK and you will win around they were you know proactively trying to find Peaks uh and you know as a guy who has worked with hooky I know that he's you know very interested in those small details you know watching the games after trying to see okay was this you duel even worth it and if he if he you know strongly believes that that duel was not necessary he will address that to that specific player you know and you know we kind of go back to the thing that I mentioned in the beginning of this this podcast was that when you hear that you're doing a lot of mistakes you're slowly you know trying to you're overthinking some scenarios and I think watching G2 today it feels like they have you know some release of pressure at least from you know hookie uh watching them so who monice is just you know rep peaking stuff uh sometimes doesn't even make any sense but he's just going for it and sometimes it works sometimes not working and I think once they start losing and he's you know keep on reeing then I think someone might uh want to address that to him and and that's that's when I think that you know there will be a downward spiral uh for their success the there's a few like overlaps of themes though that um could come into to a bit of a deeper conversation here right because FaZe are having issues at the moment we're talking about you know potentially in the future when G2 could find some issues those are two teams who you would say want to approach the game in similar ways um obviously these teams have strategies and you know they they understand how they want to play the game off of each other in scenarios but when you're talking about hookie and you know this isn't an optimal fight we shouldn't take this type of a jewel you're kind of putting a leash on um like a I guess a leash doesn't really go on a wild horse does it it would be a um a saddle a saddle a saddle yes uh uh so you're kind of putting a saddle on this this Beast that you know is so Majestic and can do all these awesome things and then you you're making it domesticated and they're not so awesome anymore right um but I I think the thing is obviously there's a balance between the two but the where I was going with this was the broader conversation is is the solution with these teams for them to actually have a higher influx of change changing players more frequently so they're constantly in this state where everything is a little bit new right where there one or two players a little bit different right so that they're then you're maybe getting an output of your your core all the time like we're not talking about having an astralis level Dynasty we're talking about maybe for a six-month period every year and a bit you're like the best team in the world like which is probably enough you know yeah if you if you time that at the right time you win the major you know you win this and that and that is in colog as G2 as G2 did you know yeah which speak at the right times like that's fine right I guess yeah yeah I mean I've thought about it so you're not the only one having voices in your head regarding this but but to H to be honest like there's so many you know teams that have you know had short runs but really decent runs like Cloud 9 winning the Boston major for example having tck as an igl know that could be the potential meta in the future you know changing uh changing players uh more frequently and being open about it also uh and just you know just putting in these extremely skilled players into a team and once you start realizing that they're overdoing stuff or overthinking stuff that's when you you know let's bring in someone else now yeah there's a i well that's the thing if there's the high if there's the understanding on the the highest level of that everyone knows how they need to play counter- strike to a degree it's not like a blade system for example because that's that's the other key distinction at the moment is na'vi we're talking about oh you know you're not getting enough out of this star player who's playing these star positions but they're winning as a team it's like they're playing some of the best team Counter-Strike at the moment and sure it helps to have bit you know have these pop off performances or JL be your major MVP for example but overall they're playing some of the best like problem solving Counterstrike I think they look at like okay this is what they've puted out we need to solve it this way or we're going to do this and then they're going to respond this way and that's why normally when blade takes the these timeouts his adjustments are like spot on because he's like well we're ready for this we knew this was going to happen and now we're just going to adjust like this guys and so I I it would be fun if one day we could get a little bit deeper down this rabbit hole but at the moment we can only really take it from the um yeah and blade is the guy who actually understands this this type of stuff you know that you're not supposed to actually say a lot in interviews about what your system is and what your thinking is about every situation sometimes that happens obviously it would be amazing for us if they did but you know teams will never share the secrets give us all the voice coms that's what we want all right um so we've spoken about do we want to talk about na'vi like what can we even say about na'vi they're going in as the favorites to the event the world number one but they've had a bit of a shaky showing against liquid who they had no tape on is that I don't know if they will actually I wonder if they're actually going to be the the betting favorite for for cologne I mean I would have to check that but but it would have to be it would have to be very close between like three four teams I would I would imagine do you think Ma would be in that I'm just looking fast I mean they could be I mean they only lost to na'vi at the at dwc right so they they could be somewhere there people do betting on Factory the fact they hav W in an arena yeah that's that's probably but but I don't know if that's something that that these these betting companies actually take into account you know they're they're generally working with uh data from from match wins you know or match results and Tournament results rather than um what type of tournament it was you know so not exactly well this is where I guess uh the group stages get a little bit interesting right so for example the fact that na'vi and spirit are on the same side these are the things that and we have G2 in there as well so this is where the groups get a bit exciting so only one of G2 or Spirit can make it straight through to the semi right uh whereas like let's say G2 vers spirit in that second round that one why Navi G2 and spirit yeah yes but both na'vi and G2 Spirit have the opportunity to try and fight for it right and if they lose that game then they're just going to be placed on the on the other side of the playoff bracket which I think is is important right because for na'vi for especially uh if you look at how the best of five uh went it it it didn't go too hot right so I'm just hoping like I'm I'm just looking at what's the worst possible case we could get for this you know like imagine liquid get thrown into that uh that group you know like it's it's I mean who else is is somewhere up there I guess complexity if they got thrown there that would also be rough because complexity and liquid all ended up in that group and be like well [ __ ] me yeah yeah yeah exactly you know it could be could be pretty pretty rough I mean not if what sorry if heroic get dexster and that that would yeah could all get him in time as well yeah that could be that could be one hell of a stack stacked group um I guess we'll find out right I mean it's uh there's always the possibility because there's some level of Randomness to to how it's decided so even if not it's like pulls pulls based on seating but then it's random between the the pools like who gets thrown in what group so there's there's always some world where it can where it can work out pretty badly yeah um but yeah I mean if if liquid got thrown into that group B I think this tournament gets very interesting like in terms of who can make the playoffs and stuff like that yeah it's a I we will'll be able to revisit this obviously we're doing a oh no we won't because we're not doing one for the group stage we doing one for the playoffs so we yeah so that's going to kind of suck in that regard okay let's um are there any other names any other big names that we want to spend some I'm talking about here that would be na'vi Mae Vitality we haven't talked about Spirit um so any of those four that anybody has Spirit probably mes we didn't see play so there's nothing new Vitality they had a good outing here but I feel like we've been oh okay this is a question quick question for you because uh You' said yeah their City sides sucked and this this time their City sides were very strong so how do you how do I respond good job I guess um but what did you see what was different was there was there something different uh I don't know most of the time I was just talking about how the work mine virus is uh affecting Justin and he's been sick since the uh 8th of July or something now um I I don't know what I saw that was different with them to be completely honest with you I feel like I've come ill equipped to talk about Vitality but um I don't know what I I I can't even remember who they [ __ ] played they remember the game allegion game because they lost the first as they beat as twice yeah well I'm a little bit off on astrales as well they only played a game Legion and then astrales twice okay well yeah I guess just just twitch drama for you then just that's all I've been keeping up with you I mean regarding spirit I said it earlier I was a bit I was a bit dejected by the game they played against complexity it just felt like they were doing they were especially ztics I mean he had a he definitely had an off game and he was he just it looked like a game where he just suddenly decided he not a smart anchor anymore and he was just like pushing for information in positions where they're in an advantage you know like pushing up ramp when they're in a 43 looking for information gets killed gives them a lower bombsite for free and it was just like one example of like 10 of the same that I saw him making the same exact game like when Anubis he gave them asight I don't know how many times from like being aggressive behind the smoke and the choke point and stuff like that like it was crazy amount of mistakes from him but it wasn't just him it was also like Shir was also putting himself in very Rive positions in situations where the it didn't really call for it and that one round where he was like uh I'm going to actually push short now mid round I was like you can't you can't make it there there's no no way and then he gets flashed and just sits in the middle between like a bomb site and short is just sitting on the ledge there and I don't know who was I think Alish like swings and sees him it's like why would he be here it's kind of like shocked that he's getting such an easy kill because was like he was I think he started that that specific round he started on middle then he went long because and he was already pushing up aggressively against a long take uh and he like made a shot there but it was obvious they were already getting the control and then he wanted to push short after that you know when they were already having long control and there was going to come the the a crunch you know from both sides so it was just very dejected but it was like one situation out of a few with sure honestly I didn't see like that that many of them but there was like couple that really stood out to me there was like another one on yuke on Lower where he was like the only one on lower and instead of like backing up to ramp where he had a teammate he ended up like hiding behind the crate where he was possibly going to get crunched from both door and uh and U what is it called well from both both sides basically of the bomb site you know so it was just like situations where I wouldn't have expected him to to go into aggressive positions when he's usually the one who's who who turns more passive and uh in situations you know where especially like in advantages and stuff like that he usually is not not a big risk taker um and in in general there were just situations where they looked very disjointed H wasn't there that's that could be that could be yeah um I actually don't know I I actually that you just clicked in my mind I wanted to come here and ask the two of you because I figured that you guys would probably be more in the no IDE yeah we didn't go there so we didn't get to ask but that is something worth asking for sure yeah hie wasn't there so I I that could have been a bit of a factor but I I I talk I know some of the moments you were talking about for me when I watch spirit it's like they were they were playing like they know that they're better than the opponents they playing against like we should just [ __ ] Crush these guys doing some of these things like that's what it felt like to me anyway yeah and it was I mean it was just one series because the other ones were like an OG which obviously we don't have high expectations of and heroic who played with S as a standing you know so they just they just blasted through those two without too big of an issue you know but yeah I don't know I I maybe you're just reading too much into one series against complexity you know that where they they had a very off ztics and honestly it felt like generally magic and uh and Shir were or Don and Shir were kind of getting trolled by by their teammates either Magics or ztics in different situations you know where they were just giving away space for for absolutely no reason just missing sprays and all that stuff you know so uh yeah maybe it's just too much reading too much into one one bad match which they ended up winning anyway um but definitely some gaps there for the entertainment P what do you make Spirit like uh are they your favorite going into colog do you have a favorite going into colog if you had to pick one yeah I don't think I I don't think I have any favor to be honest uh there's too many right there's too many teams that can win yeah yeah exactly this is not what what I'm used to at least you know we always have someone having an an era uh right now I think it's it's very open which is also you know interesting uh because you don't you don't know who is going to win like in in 2018 you knew that asales was winning but the question was who is going to be second uh so I think it's interesting but obviously I think Spirit uh they they just seem like a scary Team all over uh when you look at the names uh kind of going back a little bit to what I said with inters on C9 you know as an anchor being scared of the potential lurk uh in this case you know you're going up against Don shirro and ztics uh at the same time Chopper is he's making really good plays and also you know creating a lot of space uh uh working very good with donk on the tside so I think they're a really scary team and and if I had to put any any team of of of the ones that you guys me mentioned then I I think I would go for Spirit yeah okay yeah that I like I think that's the thing I feel like I'm such a a [ __ ] fence sitter at the moment because I'm Going In This and like I don't even have a gut feeling when I when I look at this and go oh yeah I really think these guys are are going to win it's so hard because not only does what uh like the form of these teams being a little bit all over the place uh but the way the brackets play like Striker was just talking about you were talking about it from the perspective oh it would be a real shame if all these good teams end up with the other good teams in group a and then you look at Group B where you have some teams that we're a bit more questionable about like FaZe for example who are on the downward directory VP who you know at the moment it it feels like they couldn't organize a [ __ ] piss up in a brewery like what like doesn't make any sense then you've got vitality who one day good one day not good right but they're still good so you're like well I I don't [ __ ] I don't love this analis they're not good they're still good yeah but because it's like they're good it's like they're going to beat everybody they should beat but are they going to beat all the really good teams like that's the thing so and then you have ma who they're still getting out of their diapers to play on the big stage games so that's Group B it's like well [ __ ] like who do I even want from those Group B Teams to make it through I think that's the I think that's kind of the beautiful thing about colon right I mean you just don't know you just can't know what's going to happen at this point feels like an obvious Mouse top the group and then go directly to semis and then have a nightmare oh FaZe yeah FaZe is there and they're like let's go again if they meet FaZe this time they're gonna beat them right if they meet FaZe though in the group stage and they beat them in the group stage they still would have beaten them so at the moment it's just them beating phases as a problem it's not stage game so that might be the Catalyst for M if they don't beat them now they never just GG don't even play the next time but think about that if they get the the monkey off their back of losing a FaZe let's say that FaZe show up in good form and they've somehow beat Vitality in the upper semi and Ma beat uh whoever they face and then it's ma versus uh FaZe both are in the arena but M defeat them and it's like and they and maybe they give them a hiding maybe they get some really good revenge and they go okay [ __ ] like [ __ ] now we don't have that that uh you know curse car carried around with them and then they go into the playoffs a bit looser and maybe maybe show the form that we think they can do because M they they go they're like like na'vi in a way right there's a caveat about them they're a good team at the moment but there's a caveat about them na'vi have the the caveat of the the fluke major [ __ ] and males have the caveat of well they can't win arena games and both of them are very good teams some of the actual best teams we have at the moment and the crazy part is you also have like these teams like okay I put somewhere on that discussion but like around these six teams that we're talking about like we also have you know VP have definitely not looked great but they they have the peak to beat one of these teams like on one series you know like in one one or three tries they will beat one of these teams you know and so they will just take out some favorite out of the discussion you know down the line even if they're not going to have a real chance at winning the tournament you know so it's like it's we could yeah I mean we could be we could be up for like 10 different variations of the bracket at this point like it's crazy all right well I really don't know where to Pivot from here because I mean we should probably uh we have the what are the odds and we have the giveaway oh let's do that yeah talk about Vitality with that right yeah okay cool I think we can we've been a bit more roundabout because I didn't want to focus on every matchup in the bracket and everything like that and there might be some surprise teams but at at the end of the day like [ __ ] there's 24 teams to cover guys um we're just going to do more with the headlines okay so let's do what are the odds Lucas oh oh we do the like we doing the giveaway first um let's uh yeah let's get people um how how do they win and the keyword is exclamation Mar exclamation mark One X bet Just One X bet Just One X bet no exclamation not just one X only one x o n l why 1 x bet type that in chat right as a number or as a number as a number yeah as everyone's doing that is your raffle ticket to potentially win the knife that you see on screen uh because we've been doing the segment uh what are the odds and that's they earned themselves some money didn't they Prof the people are yes they did around €200 EUR or something and uh also this is where you started the second the second season um for for the fall part of the year and we have already uh accumulated 150 or you have with your predictions by backing Ms to have a high rating disc calls that was kind of an obvious like a safe bet uh came through and also C9 uh to win a series uh to not win a series to be more accurate and there's like 85 EUR from that so almost equal the first uh half of the year in like what it's August is that mean we're doing something wrong no I think just people are guessing correctly that's that's it okay all right nice so we'll draw this at the end of the segment I guess let's uh everyone can keep spamming it cuz one expert will love the interaction uh but one of the odds in this week's question is drum roll please I will post a 1.2 rating in Cologne playoffs well there like there's like levels to this you know because like first of all we don't even know if he's going to make it there because I was I saw thread today it was like zyu Farms cologne at haters and uh it's a that he has one MVP two MVPs and an EVP from cologne and it's like average rating is 1 point I don't know the lowest rating is 1.24 or something but that is across the whole tournament um so is this fake news uh being posted or is it uh or is it also fake news but in a different way is this you know uh manipulating the the stats for for fake facts is he is he going to deliver because the the general idea is that he and col that's what people are trying to put out there now okay all right so this is an interesting one so as as you said there are layers to this uh obviously the layers are are they going to make the playoffs being one of them and then is z going to be in good form now I would say based off the conversation we just had there's a fair chance that Vitality would make the playoffs considering the way that that group looks at the moment we don't know who the other teams are going to be in that pool but phaser inan if they get thrown like liquid in the first match who who know so I would hedge that they they would make the playoffs I think that would probably be a fair assion to make with Vitality at the moment and and probably an expectation of of their team uh but then regarding zyu well but I want to I kind of like I'm not a zwu hater I'm also not a z lover like I'm just I just just you're just a z I'm just a well yeah uh like I I don't I would just kind of want to be really lame and just be like 50% like I know I need to base it in a bit of logic here but Chad moments for me it's like this is the thing man I understand he's a star player I get all the conversations that we have about all of this [ __ ] and I understand that you need players who are going to be consistent and they're going to deliver right but he plays well sometimes he plays the the the gun sometimes he plays the big zoomi gun um sometimes he does sometimes he doesn't but it like this that's it right it's for me I just boils down to this and again I I I'm very aware that he is meant to be able to deliver the numbers but it's [ __ ] Counter-Strike at the end of day like I feel I what does that mean it's Counterstrike what does that mean anything can happen bro anything can happen anything carrian can drop 30 you know anything is possible like and that's not a dig at carrian that's just say like anything can [ __ ] happen um Vitality the side of the group if they go if they's say okay so they're probably going to play ma in the game to go straight towards semis let's say they lose to Ma so that means they're going to be second in the group that means they're going to play Third Place team from group oh imagine trying to predict who they're actually going to play I'm trying you can't predict that but there's but if they play third place from group a they play either na'vi Spirit or G2 yeah sure maybe okay can I change my percentage Yeah you can based off of the research I've Done Right In This Moment I'm going to put it at cuz I don't those three names I just said I don't think they would be but well if it hold up no keep at 50 because they're going to lose but Z is going to play well I was I was somewhere that as well he could play one series you know the it yeah he's gonna play one series and he's going to play well and he's going to get the 1. two it's all going to be fine oh that's mine P do you get how the game works yeah I think I do you just need to give a percentage ultimately but also tell us a bit about your reasoning sure sure um I'm a little bit also you know looking now at the the uh potential like let's say they they make it through their uh group really depends on you know who they're going to face uh you know okay let's say na'vi G to Spirit make it out of the group from group a if they get G2 I think he will post above 120 oh and the reason why is I think the G2 players will play a bit loose where where he will be in a position and a situation where he will be able to get easy pickoffs while as let's say they going up against na'vi as you mentioned sponge they're playing really good team CS then they know how to handle uh going into the positions of zyu it really depends on who they they will be playing uh at least in in the first matchup uh depending on if they plays first second or third um that's a tough one uh I don't know am I boring if I also put 50% no can put 51 yeah why not of course all right 51 someone said why didn't I put 49 why didn't I put 69 you know anything possible I'm going to give it less because I'm I'm trying to just like math it in my head I think chances for them to go through are pretty high but that's like 75 80% and then is he going to post a 120 rating I think it's kind of on the on the 50/50 there oh is it I think it's 5050 in the match but there's also will he get to that match so in my if you add those two up and then there's also the possibility to play multiple matches so it need to play multiple matches to a high degree which I think lowers that to like a 32% wow okay so you you've got you've got 5050 I got like 70% and then you know 50% of that 70% like and then could be a bit lower that's my quick Mass okay I'm going to say so I I actually I tried to go somewhat scientifically about it as well and like similarly as Prof except I think 50 to give him 50% to hit 120 in the playoffs is low I think it's like I was going back through his like playoffs ratings for the last 10 events or so and he's not hit 120 for the playoffs like once which is the major which where you know he was sick and blah blah blah so like it is rare for him not to drop 12s in any time he makes playoffs like so I would give it the more like I'll say 80% even like if in total huh total your total percent is 80% no no no 80% for the for that he will he will do he will do 120 in the playoffs but then there's the if will they even make it there sure I would say it's higher than 50% I would say but I would like average it down to 60 60% okay still okay oh hey okay I think my would actually be get even higher from 80% just dropping 120s because he's they're probably also going to make the playoffs in like 70% cases or whatever so generally it would probably be even higher but my my subjective opinion just drops it a little bit they would have to get shut out right really badly for him to have like an absolute stinker like it's that's the thing like I feel like the the conversation around on has shifted to a point where people think he's [ __ ] just because he's not dropping 140 ratings in every season series you know but he still drops 120s like every time he plays even if that's not good enough for zyu it's still he still does it sure yeah no fair enough okay so look again we haven't covered off all the teams are there any names from the play-ins that leap off the page of you guys have being relatively exciting um like did Big have a chance with rigon was anybody happy with what they saw from Big um who else could I guess we spoke about Fury a bit before mibr had a pretty abysmal showing at ewc Magis I feel bad for him but he he put himself in this position everybody's calling for him to come back to Vitality because he's so [ __ ] good and he has nothing to do with that team that's uh he I mean he had kind of a he had a way better tournament in Blast as well than he usually does so it's not like it's just like he's he's playing like this all the time but it was really a rough seeing him do those things and then just lose oh uh quickly we need to draw the winner uh of the N so I hope everybody has got their raffle ticket in and the winner is Zach that is zacc kkz and congratulations I'm sure our people will reach out to your people and uh we will get you the knife so congratulations and send us a screenshot of you uh using it looks pretty nice yeah well there is no contractual agreement that you have to use the knife um if you just want to look at the knife then yeah that's cool too so yeah all right well I feel that we did a good job of talking about the themes around a lot of the teams that are here especially the ones that people care about the most we definitely didn't service every area of all of the fan bases can't wait for a team that we didn't mention to win but actually we're going to do the pre-playoff episode so we can address it then so we will be able to address that but I I don't I don't know as far as large story lines go if we necessarily missed anything I think we touched on most of it um we didn't really go into VP but they're not really giving much at the moment uh should we should we quickly and then then wind her up I don't remember I watched the liquid game for I mean obviously but that's about it yeah I didn't watch the second one no [ __ ] VP we'll talk about them after okay well uh let's let's uh I guess we wind it up P thank you for joining us tonight um are you doing any more broadcasting coming up shortly for for the swedes yeah actually tomorrow Johnny speeds maybe will qualify for uh b boom they
