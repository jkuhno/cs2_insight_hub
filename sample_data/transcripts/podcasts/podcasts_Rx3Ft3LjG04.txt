where I'm not too stressed like honestly you did all of the prep for the for the show I was like just I'll just walk in it'll be fine of course it's not fine the camera just doesn't work it's working oh no it's not working so I guess you just have to you just have to have have it sometimes no we'll Tech issues and uh look see my camera just spazzed out as well so uh this is just the internet now look if I start lagging I'm on 5G so blame that and I'm on the other side of the world so I probably already am lagging uh but look let's get down to business because I guess for this evening I mentioned it he's a bloody vet of the scene it's uh I'm going to do it I'm going to butcher your name and that's my finish I really like it's so sing songy but it's great to have you here natu perfectly timed I messaged you like a week and a half ago about this and it's all kind of panned out perfectly with the news uh thank you for joining us now before we get into the hot seat before we get into the meat and potatoes we were just talking about a blizzard is your life like the movie Frozen uh more or less yeah uh at least the part that it's cold and right now it's it's extremely cold uh for even for November in Finland so what about the singing part yeah is it a musical every day uh I mean I have a daughter she likes singing so yeah okay I can't are are you a do you do the the esport karaoke what's your go-to song on that uh I I I try avoid it uh I haven't I haven't been singing in years in karaoke uh I don't think I've ever done it in any Esports event actually so only only with friends uh and it's been many moons ago since that was a thing so no okay so it's only cold in the virtue of Frozen and things are pretty animated but but not in the sense of an animated movie all right all right all right uh I wrote some notes I did write some notes so uh look I just want to make sure that I do my introduction correctly for maybe those who aren't too familiar with yatu now uh you are an EXC Counter-Strike player uh over multiple iterations of the game you've been doing it longer than most people even know how to put a mouse and keyboard in the right direction considering how old we're getting in the new generation of Counterstrike coming through uh you are a co-founder of n the marketing director over there right now and uh an absolute Legend of Finnish Counterstrike someone who had to play with Tommy back in the day so you've seen you've seen some um you've really been through all of it uh how is uh how's how's life in general at the at the moment I know I spoke about the blizzard but it's it's always good actually no let's get into the hot seat because the first little first little thing I have is catching up with natu that'll be perfect Lucas roll the bumper now we're warming things up with the heart seat now that's great uh when the weather outside is frightful what is the perfect sauna conditions uh is it like 80 to 100Â° Cel what are we talking about um depends if it's a if it's a wooden or an electric uh with a wooden um one you can you can have it higher but I think for one that is with an electric sauna sto uh probably like an 80 other because the like the steam the a gets a bit dry uh but it yeah that's the difference I guess you know so you're doing you're doing wet wet saers or dry we're only doing dry saers you're not doing like steam rooms uh I think that's for to be fair you know okay fair enough yeah not fair enough so what's the preference there there's a question in the on the Twitter sphere uh wood or electric I would all the way I mean I have a I have an electric one at home because it's just more convenient I have an option to put a wood one have one installed uh but just for the convenience you know being a lazy bastard you know at home it's better to have an electric one it's faster you push a button it goes on push a button it goes off right um but for you know a summer you have a summer house very typically a lot of fins at one uh like you have a sauna by the lake for example you always want to have a wooden wouldn't he one in those conditions less of a chance to burn the house down huh less of a chance to burn the house down yeah that's true I guess I guess but I I mean I I do have like the most probably the most um famous hot tub of all of Finland which is heated by wood so um right next to my house who's the the last uh Counterstrike player that's in that hot tub um actually I think that's Alo I knew I don't know why but I knew the answer like before you said it it's so funny wait who was it Alo oh really okay all right all right all right two summers ago maybe like not this one but the previous uh Counterstrike players out there then um maybe oh I mean if you disturbed us to play back in the day he was he was there as well that same very the same occasion um I've had over the years I've had um s uh Henry um then those guys came over one year for an assembly and uh heard the story about Henry and that hot tub so uh there's a lot of running around I believe yeah well let's just put it this way it's not for this show I think I don't think think that story no there was there was no clothes it was uh it was it was one of those type of occasions wasn't it maybe a few beverages consumed continue in this direction we're gonna have to change the category on Twitch I feel like ex or maybe the platform you know no they've made a whole hot tub section just put that in the background we can basically get naked who gives a apparently these days um all right what else have been going on Nat anything else people should know other than than the the Counter-Strike Focus stuff or do you want to get into that is is there anything that's that's not business because it's great to hear that you just I love it I've got a s in my house fing hot tub it's being of Finn sounds awesome uh I was Shing a lot of snow today uh it's been it's been snowing a lot so it's not been a very exciting day in that sense uh apart from that it's a busy week at work because of the Elisa Masters that's happening here in Finland um So that obviously means with of of course all the uh the things that have been going on uh announcing players leaving and coming and whatnot uh or a player and a coach um then we're also obviously planning for an event and we will have a massive presence there so um that's been consuming a lot of energy and time at work uh and I mean I thought you know working for a team and not being a talent traveling everywhere would actually be a little bit more stable but yeah that was a good lie to myself uh it's a roller coaster but doesn't involve a lot that many planes in hotel nights I guess you know I'm working on my three-year plan right now Nat to don't say that I was trying to get an offramp to do something a little bit more stable and now you're telling me it's going to be regardless like okay it's all all right all right all right well uh look let's get into uh let's get into some soury stuff shall we because as you just mentioned the changing of a coach and a player uh what 24 hours ago I imagine it was that maybe I'm off by a little bit I also just slept for eight so if I missed any news uh you guys can let me know but uh we we had saw and snappy um and said goodbye to them uh yeah about 24 hours ago um this has obviously been something that's been in the works for for some time but I I kind of wanted to start it at the at the beginning um of of when these Rumblings began because there's been rumors about Snappy to Falcons for for quite a while now saw being in the mix I think is something that caught people a little bit more off guard unless your named Striker The Evil Genius stroking the cat on the lap and knows everything that's going on in Counterstrike but I don't know how much you can divulge but at what point did any conversations start for for some of your some of your players especially these two um I think you know uh it's not more than maybe I might be off by a week but like two three weeks ago um maybe three weeks ago when like we know that there was a consideration uh from Marco's side of what he wants to do next um of course he's he's had off first throughout throughout the years A lot of them considering how well the team has been doing uh and now he's contract was was expiring you know he was he was having a lot of different options um we were very much in the running as well in that and it was a tough one for him to choose what he wants to do in the future um but yeah I mean it was a yeah I think it was about less than a month ago when it kind of like surface for us and of course we kind of started thinking of the the possibility we were hopeful that he would want to stay with us but uh yeah of course we were thinking of plan B's and plan C's and plan D's for for quite some time uh just to make sure you know that we were in a good spot going forward now I I I again I actually did some work for this one and and wrot up some information so the viewer if they're not all plugged in I can give them a little bit here now saw joined an back uh in 2020 as a coach and he came actually across as a player then into that coaching role and you had Snappy join an in early 2021 and then that's when the team essentially started to go full International right moving away from the finished players like dodo and Alo were some of the last finish players you had on the team and then this iteration of the roster the one that people might remember is with nurs joining early this year I think it's back in February they you guys recovered from the whole vda situation maybe one of those forgetful situations in the an office uh they had like 110 maps played together there were two semi-finals e 17 and 18 trophy lift at IM Dallas over Ms a second place at IM cologne a second place at game 8 uh really exciting Counter Strike to that was being played right the the type of n Counterstrike was fun I'm sure giving you a heart attack more often than not and you had some lovable personalities within that team and now it's kind of all run its course and come to its end and you've had to deal with this kind of uh I don't want to even call it like a roster Shuffle period because now it just feels like every day we're shuffl and that was actually a reference to a song guys 15 years ago that just came to me I forget the name of them but one of the guys had fuzzy hair um so it it feels like the end of the year shouldn't have been this tumultuous does this does this feel like it kind of came from nowhere or you knew that it was going to get busy like this um actually not too long ago I I still felt like you know we were in a pretty good position and it didn't feel like we necessarily would be getting hit massively by uh by by by what's going on you know it was easy to read between the lines of course like in the big picture not just talking about us but that like the second major not going to be happening until the early next year that this is going to be a bit of a different um end of this season um so uh in that sense I mean I guess I should not be like no one should be surprised that um um and of course considering like how well the team has been doing you know IGS are especially are hard to be found like really really good ones so uh I mean yeah I'm not I'm not surprised but uh it's uh it is a bit of a Mayhem going on behind the behind the curtains for sure you know there's a lot of things there's a bubbling a lot of things that are like I'm talking in generally speaking uh that uh yeah and the way way some of the things are happening are not necess the way that's just put let's put it this way it's not in the uh from the book of Ethics how some of the things are are happening out there right now so uh but that's what it is we're we're dealing with a with a sport or a game with very little regulation in everything so um you know that's kind of nature of the Beast that uh sometimes might get a bit feisty what do you what do you mean not not necessarily the book of Ethics from what kind of standpoint uh it just feels like there's liter collusion between like teams agents players and just going on in the background you know collusion is always a fun word you know yeah yeah just a lot of just a lot of going on but uh it is what it is and then you kind kind of have to live with it and that's it so does it feel like it's back room dealings like we had on Steam once upon a time where we're all IRC but you have to deal with the contracts and the Agents going on at the same time yeah no pretty much yeah it's pretty much just the big boy version it's like feels like I'm just laughing like it's like people are playing Fantasy Football manager but it's in real life for Counterstrike with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of buyouts that just seem like impossible to manage it's like man some of these buyouts I'm hearing about where the is the money coming from does this grow on trees or something have I missed the memo uh yeah I me considering it's Easter Rich Winter as we we know and I guess we're going to dwell into that a bit later as well um yeah it does raise a question in my uh in me as well like you know does money actually grow in trees or how does it work you know we don't have any money trees in Finland that that's for sure because it's too cold it needs to be in hotter climate burning it all in the SAA no I was going to ask if it was like FR if it was frustrating because obviously like you've been you Pride yourselves on you know not taking any investment investment money and and being profitable for most of your uh most of your uh tenure as an organization and I mean it's got to be frustrating to some degree you know sometimes to have to deal with all the money that is flying around everywhere else you know if you don't have that uh in your pocket yeah I mean sure uh it is a it is a an industry where where uh spending more money means you know getting more I guess uh but at the end of the day you know I also pride in the fact that we've been able to manage to build worldclass teams multiple times with reasonable budgets uh still players being paid well um and yeah I mean I guess also like in the sense that we haven't just spent a lot of money in other games and do stupid stuff like that you know we've really been hyperfocused in Counter Strike whereas I feel like a lot of organizations are struggling because they're just simply wasting money in in different games that have not returned or have had not had not had returns that they were expecting um so yeah I think we're kind of leading into the whole org SL economy side anyway so I think we can just go into that Direction with the with the show just for a bit because I think it's uh interesting like from from things that I've also heard it felt like this was a time not to invest more it was like almost like as if orgs were I mean Chad you were speaking about this like maybe a month or two ago on the show that especially with the 2025 changes with all of the leagues kind of going away and the revenue share from the leagues most likely going away unless they figure out a new way to do stuff um that orgs are simply not going to earn the same amount of money in CS as they were or maybe they will earn the same amount but it's going to be harder to predict right so with lack of stability you're kind of you want a downsize you want to be safe and uh I heard from people that that was a kind of the idea for these like few months for the kind of until the next major people are just going to renegotiate contract be like be a bit more safe as spending but then it kind of turned around with with Falcons and maybe liquid coming in with a with a bigger spending is that kind of how you thought it was going to go or did did this kind of come out of nowhere essentially the the spending yeah yeah I I I do agree like the vibe was really was that we were kind of getting a bit more sense in this scene and the spending for sure uh considering that there's a lot of unknowns you know uh as you mentioned going into 2025 and onwards in Counter Strike uh but it's as as as soon as someone mention Saudi money everyone just lost their it feels like uh and that's when some kind of an implosion happened and it's not just it's not just them there's other other players also in this in this market that are overspending I don't think liid is one of them probably like for me they are like one of the models of how things should be run right like they've been doing a good business for for many many years uh but uh yeah I yeah it it it did feel like it would kind of get into a more reasonable kind of a climate but yeah that's when the the the whole Falcons rumor started coming in that they were going to be investing big then yeah everyone just lost their basically it feels like it it is an interesting situation to find our in because Falcons haven't been able to get the players they want you know you want to tell us is Snappy going to Falcons and it's I guess s's not going with him you can spill the news right here confirm it yeah that's a good good question I wish I knew I wish I knew oh this uh this wait wait but at least one thing that you probably can say because it was like in the video and I think like people maybe took the wrong impression is that they're not going together it's not a c package deal type thing not that I'm aware of no okay oh maybe there's another back deal that you're like you sell sell a player to someone and he sells him off the next day my team lot lot of snake oil out there boys okay so that's a that's that's a good little piece of information that's something that I've missed in uh in the last 24 hours so that they're not I thought that there was a video where like you know you I was praising you guys saying not that I'm aware of you know right right uh I was just like in your announcement video you know like Snappy literally said like I'll miss working with sa you know like in the in the goodbye video you know so I mean obviously you know you can take that as you want it could be just him you know yeah being uh um trying to be secretive or like trying to catch people off guard but I can just say that like as far as I know as well they are not going together to fut that would be tin foil tin foil type stuff if he actually didn't say that and they ended up in the same team a great Dynamic though because that's the thing I didn't think obviously the two of them would go together to Falcons but like Snappy and saw let's say in some kind of crazy world could go to heroic right they need an ingame leader right now you could bring s in you've got the big boss little boss uh combo right the that that was the how they were affectionately known within within and and that relationship and it's obviously a strong relationship considering what the team was able to achieve and Elevate thems to so like I thought maybe that could be a possibility if they were going to stay together but it's interesting that they're not staying together and we had the departure at the the same time so I I'm actually okay well that that kind of makes things a little bit clearer for me on what I think is going to happen now I mean uh yeah I mean um the I think a lot of people also kind of read that in the uh uh the interview GL gave that um you know CLA was kind of in between like who who which which Co coaches is going to be playing for um so yeah I mean I could say that the the the the change was not initiated at the same time or things were not happening simultaneously but kind of back toback in a sense so first we were without an igl and then as we were working working progress for for new igl we were also in a situation where we had no no head coach so um yeah couldn't couldn't be more in that regard let's just take out the entire Brain Trust of the team the people who built what's been working for the better part of the last couple of years that that must have be because essentially now right I guess we can start to Pivot into talking more of of of the lay of the land and and how we find oursel now we did uh a Vox pop to get the people at home's opinion on what they think about the snappy versus gave obviously not head-to-head but in terms of how this looks and plugging and playing with ingame leaders and you mentioned before it's not easy uh with the capap of ingame leaders at the moment they they're definitely worth their their weight in gold and then to get good ones especially one of the caliber of glaive who still hasn't been on our screens in some time at least in a successful fashion um you know I I don't imagine you had I'm trying to think of the choices that you would have even been able to look at for in-game leaders so we're talking about nean right maybe if if we're we're really scratching different parts of the barrel here glaive is someone who I think we've all known has kind of been he's around but my questioned and I still I still do like uh I need to go and read that interview I think that that did come out while I was asleep but one of the questions when I see glaive coming in is what's the motivation levels looking like you've already you're already one of the most accomplished members of C but we can bring the poll up now that we did at the Vox Pop I think I was just looking at this on Instagram before so the question was GLA and said a Snappy upgrade or downgrade now this is one where uh you know it's you can you can say a lot of things about this now if we bring up the the results we can see people are saying an upgrade almost overwhelmingly uh about the same uh slight downgrade or significant downgrade so it's interesting to see how people have measured this Prof what do you make of these results here do you think people just see the name glaive and go four majors four majors I was insanely surprised I think this is I think no one that watches counter- strike actively can say this and be like this is a upgrade like it's it's insane it's it can be better long term but what we know about these two players today in no way can you say like glaive is is going to make ends better than Snappy is making them right now it's Absolut it's a it's crazy and I when I saw this I also think the these are like the the Instagram voters that are now included that that like vote a lot more there's just more people than on Twitter it's it's that are more maybe more on the Casual side that's my only explanation because this is Instagram uses like pictures Twitter uses like words what does that what does that mean Chad though what does that mean well I don't I don't know but I'm just kind of simplifying things here aren't I I want to see the Twitter I'm going to look up the Twitter results just to see for a second uh yeah I think on Twitter 40% is slight downgrade you know so but there's a lot less votes so that's where that's where the brdes that's where the smart people are that's what I'm yeah but what what do you think Striker when you see something like that when you're listing the pros and cons of all of this you stack up the pros for snappy you stack up the cons for glaive oh sorry the pros for glaive and then you have your cons list as well yeah hell um how how does it how does it feel in your mind you know what's what's your smise of this situation I mean I think the biggest thing that people probably have to be focusing on is that this is not gav's project right at least not at the moment like that's the that's what also separates the two people you know because Snappy was the one who and Nat to I'm sure can can uh uh can confirm this sppy had a massive voice in the team in terms of like who to pick up and a lot of was a big part of The Scouting process along with saw and so glaive is coming into a a full team you know and instead of building it himself you know so that's also a big difference you know you're not going to be the guy who has the authority from the start because you weren't the guy who brought them on and who you know now had that sort of success with them you know so even from that perspective just even ignoring their results recently you know which obviously speak massively in Snappy's favor because of also gla's you know kind of disappearance after the estris benching and the time that you know he had towards the end of his astralis time you know so uh just all of it together like you cannot you cannot conclusively say that this is an upgrade because of just because of this Factor this is this is a this is just a proof that democracy is like a failed concept like like people don't know what they what they're talking about that's that's it yeah but someone geted but that being said that being said it's not like I still I personally believe glaive has something to give with with the fact that his like last year in astris was horrible this is just a fact I don't think he can he would even say anything about this like we can all agree on that but the it's not like he is never going to do anything again I don't think that's true like there is question marks about motivation and I think this is kind of the question for you not like why what convinced you guys that that he is the right choice a four-time major Champion I mean it does count it does help he could be the worst player in the world if he's a four-time major Champion you know in the past that that does bring something you know yeah you know a culture winning we were win we were losing a lot of grand finals you guys saw right um I'm I'm joking uh but yeah no I mean um he was a top priority for us for sure as a player you know if he's pedigree um yes sure he was way for for a while yes he he he had to struggle with aalis for for a good amount of time but you know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to kind of look through what was going on on in australas over the last couple of years there's there's always a lot of variables that affect on the performance of the igl right um but still he has to kind of carry that weight he has to carry the responsibility of the results at the end of the day um and yeah just he he was a guy who for sure we had questions also so like you have to you have to answer to yourself like the motivation level considering that he's kind of run through the whole game that was csgo now we're in CS2 I guess so uh but still he really convinced us of his of his motivation and he his will to work uh and wanted to be a part of a project where he does get to be Hands-On because at towards detailing of AAL seemingly he was a bit more hands off obviously I wasn't there so um I don't know how things P how how things actually worked in in in their organization but here most definitely he gets to be much more Hands-On uh and um similar to what what Marco was in the team and um making sure that in the long run we're making the right choices in terms of players so you're saying like they're G to have as much of a say in or like as much of a power in scouting as a doo even like together with Cuban uh as you know the other two guys had the a goes that uh always hire smarter people than yourself uh and that's kind of what we went for here as well you know hiring smart people they both convinced us that they they have the eye they have obviously the pedigree they have the the resume uh and they have the uh the hunger to work for it so yeah 100% we want to listen to these guys and they and have them you know uh have a say in who who's playing in the team 100% not only is this like a diff two difficult roles to fill right you look at an right now so in the current HTV world rankings fourth but regardless it's one of the upper echelon Elite level Counterstrike teams it is right now so results are let's say expected I think that's probably Fair considering the the trajectory the team's been on so you come into that as glaive someone who you mentioned has the culture of winning someone who knows what it takes to win so that's great there but you're bringing in the people who now have to decide how the team is going to play but the team has already been playing a certain way that has been successful and now you have this like couple of events at the tail end of the year where you need to kind of feel each other out and work out because I don't imagine GLA and Cuban are GNA come in and go all right guys we're doing things our way you know they're going to come in and and go all right well it's the four players like and the star you still got nerds and some here and then you still got your your backbone your very pivotal impact players like your Madden and your deaz and then now gla's going to come well he's not just going to be a Snappy clone right so things are going to shift around but I don't imagine immediately so it's hard to imagine it's hard to set expectations as a team right now so you you've have some events coming up you you have an event on quote unquote home soil Finnish organization but no fins in the team anymore goodbye saw um so how do you even how do you what what do you say it's like all right guys we're just going to go into this event and whatever happens happens this is all just the feeling out process for the rest of the year or no let's you know let's try and put in some good results we don't want to go out in last place in these events what's the conversation like that being with these blows coming in um um I think the the foundation like the the four guys have as a as a you know having played already um majority of this year this the other four uh they have so much routine together I don't think it would make sense also for new aan coach come in and just throw everything in the bin and start all over considering that there is a lot of uh routines already built between these players um and so I believe that the approach they will have is that that they're not going to start like changing million things in the first first outing they started practicing together what was it maybe Wednesday last week uh and they tomorrow tomorrow they play their first game so they have that solid five days of practice so yeah you're not going to change you know a whole map Pool and everything in in that kind of time so I think it's going to be baby steps uh and of course like there's going to be Nuance that these two are going to be bringing into the game uh I think that's a positive thing but then the foundation will be what they've been doing for what the team has been doing for the better part of of this year did you have a conversation with glaive you know this is the first time that he's going to be leading an international team and we've heard from people like carrian and stappy you know who who have been of the opinion that it needs to be simpler you know than like leading a team such as that and not having such so much set structure you know behind the team and how much like their reactions and all that than when you have a five of of of people who are speaking than their native language did you ever have that conversation with him and and what his approach to that is at the moment uh I haven't had that conversation with him but uh generally speaking I would I would assess like I would think that that is true but at the same time the the High Caliber players are so smart nowadays that um the the way you can play when you are not speaking your native language is relying more on individuals decision makings and having certain rules of thumb you have in the game or certain thing when when X Y or Z happens and there's just different reactions for example and players having the freedom to make plays and everyone else knows how to react around them uh and I think we have those type of players in this team uh for sure so uh I guess not having spoken with him about it but I I um at least for me you know it kind of makes sense that you kind of have to play that way okay I have a question uh kind of kind of leaning on to I think this was a conversation on Twitter a few months ago um I don't know what sparked it but essentially this kind of community [Music] perception of ANS being kind of like a budget team kind of kind of being happy to be a talent form I think that was that was a sentiment I was going around and I think it was you that that replied that was kind of so I think this is a good place to start so I'll just tell just let you explain what you think and then we can maybe roll on for that from that uh yeah no I mean there's been this ongoing narrative that I keep finding like in different like your reddits HL TV whatever everywhere uh basically saying that you know oh NC is the team that is willing to just sell out the players and making good bank out of that but if we look at history you know that's not true um we've what did I put we've sold over this course of the time up until that we we had sold what Spinx and valde and Spinx was the only one that was an active player and even then we had a situation where we didn't want to sell him but he wanted to go go to vitality zyu was calling so you know fair play so there was not really anything we could do in that situation even though we did ask him like hey what does it take for you to stay here because we had a good thing going on at the time um valde was was a bench player when we moved over to TSM so uh but apart from that you know I I think the track record we've had is is that no we've gone for good upgrades you know doing these different movements we've also spent money you know buying players out of their contracts um multitude of time so no it's not true we're just we're just playing this game our way uh we're not going to be like the biggest spender we're not going to go out spending crazy money on buyouts and things like that that don't make sense but we will also take risk and we will also invest when it does make sense so um yeah I mean the evidence is out there we're definitely not a farm team we're definitely not a team that's just you know signing play Young talented players to then eventually sell them because well we haven't done that so yeah end of it yeah I mean it also helped that you guys were successful enough to be able to like keep those players as well you know because that helps but doesn't that build back into the model though it shows what they're doing is like is is is working in itself that's the thing it's like and I I like because let's get into more of the the business side of things this is this is a side that I really enjoy um because you were talking before about teams investing in other games and doing all this other stuff whereas an are a lot more Counter-Strike focused obviously do you still have your Starcraft boy forget his name name uh no uh no he M over sorry Nat to no it's fine it's fine he's uh so that ran his course I mean basically won everything became the goat in the game and then moved over to uh someone's passion project in the US who it's willing to pay well for playing Starcraft so you know all good not many of those left anymore so and we're trying to run a business here I I think you know with all all due respect to him like he's so much Legacy and so much respect for all the achievements he brought in but starkov 2 was like the only game that was not a business decision like business driven decision to keep it was more about the Legacy and the the fact that he was the go of his game and um yeah but uh yeah okay so when we when we look at this uh this touted Esports winter right it's something that I've muted a couple of times from a position of ignorance uh or just more so from the broadcast Talent side right obviously we have discussions with the companies that we work for and we hear things on our end as well um you see with a lot of big tech companies that aren't even connected with video games that they're you know we're we're in a recession right I don't know if know if I can use official terms around here so nobody take this as economic advice but uh as far as I understand things are things are tough out there things aren't easy um so with that you know the first thing to go is the strip clubs and then after that would be Esports teams so um you know the the there's a downturn in spending in those areas and as we we move into this Esports winter you've been through a couple I remember I I had a fun one it was like 2008 with the CGS and then everything just kind of stopped right we had a recession back then as well we had the the GFC the global financial crisis for those of you old enough to remember but we're in another position where uh it's slowing in that area and from your outlook and perspective is this going to be one that we can weather quite easily is this going to be one that's going to last a while what type of uh what type of entities do you think are going to be impacted here um I mean of course we we are in a curious position because as mentioned you know we don't have Venture Capital we don't have investors who are going to be asking for their returns because a lot of their Investments are melting left and right and Center uh so for us it's a kind of like like we're only responsible to ourselves of course it's going to like it's hit us in the way that it's hard for sure harder to get commercial Partnerships long-term Partnerships are way harder you can definitely tell that um and yeah just the amount of money spent in marketing in in general right now it's just trending uh down I think it's it's been there's been a bit of light at the end of the tunnel right now I feel like but in the big picture that's been that's been an issue but I mean we see it from like the uh a lot of the American organizations they are that are VC driven heavily uh or laying people off you know we all know what's going on with ag uh hun thieves a lot of these you know big ones that have been investing a lot in trying to sort of buy a lot of Market space and build big brands but then not being able to get the kind of returns um out of the franchise leagues that they were expecting um so I think this is actually good it's it's definitely a good thing because it's just um we're getting some steam out of this this bubble right we're getting into the more correct sized bubble now instead of the overblown one which we've had for many many years um I remember like back when OverWatch League was being built now rip through that League uh and the amount of money that was pushed into that with with the kind of numbers and the vision that was or the projections that were were I even saw some of the projections for for the coming years and I was like that's never going to happen right and now we are in that reality that it didn't uh so we we see that kind of a crash happening but I think it's for the good now yes we will lose some some good ones on along the way but at the end of the day this is that's going the thing that's going to kind of um correct the course um and make things better in the the long run I think the one big thing we need to kind of figure out uh one day or the other in the future I think a lot of the viewers are going to hate this one but like how do we monetize the viewers better oh they are gonna hate that one not to they're really gonna hate that one it is what it is right that's the fact the matter I mean remember when we used to do when I used to do pro league as well uh with you and the other guys like we used to be on Facebook gaming uh for the fact that there was actually someone Bay paying for the broadcast to be on that platform right just sellouts that we had the viewers though now to right like we just we just you know that's that's it that's we're doing all these things that's an example like you know like now because everyone hated it I mean it was a shitty platform but still you know in the big picture because everyone wants to be on one specific platform then no one's going to pay for the broadcasting rights anymore whatnot so there's a lot of these questions that need to be answered and there's a lot of question marks now with the with the uh also with the uh franchise leagues and Counter Strike you know being shut down and all that kind of stuff so so a lot of question marks that was a long run sorry no it's all right it's all right I I because I look at um like how self-contained you are at an and I this is one of the things that I preach because coming 2025 no more P leagues thank God we go back to Wild Wild West which I think there's going to come with some changes of how Val going to want to run the circuit anyway I don't know when we're going to get information on that I don't know if you have more information that as someone who's part of a team but no no one knows anything and that's the scary part that's the scary part but what what valve have essentially done with the the the revenue that is able to be accured from these stickers is teams who can be successful time and time again um and are investing that money wisely and being able to pump it back into their business instead of having 643 different teams and like having to worry about spreading that money across an entire organization as opposed to just a core group of people a core business that's Counterstrike focused where I'm going with this is I feel that if you have people people who know what they're doing who have been in the industry who you know get help from outside who can help Point these things in the right direction but actually know Counter Strike and know what we're dealing with you can run something that is lucrative and you can actually have like a decent business like we're not talking about stupid money we're talking about good money but we're not lighting it it doesn't seem to me like an light money on fire where a lot of these other it feels like they light money on fire and the amount of money that you can get from valve from a major is insane that's insane money it's twice a year I know it wasn't this year but in other years you can be making hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars from stickers well to to make up for the fact that there was no second major let's just say that they ran the stickers for as long as they possibly could have yeah that was insane like the the numbers that I've heard around the the sticker styles from from the Paris major absolutely mental like it feels like Counter Strike looks after counter- strike is that the the impression that you get natu uh yeah I guess so but at the same time also there's like I said there's a lot of unknowns that I think especially for someone who's running a business it's a bit hard to try to budget or think of the feel like who knows next major they just decide there's no stickers where you know I obviously it doesn't make sense that there would not be but they technically could do that so imagine you're making a budget thinking okay with this type of a team we're gonna make the major and we can estimate an XY or Z amount of money out of it uh we can we can build different scenarios and then all of a sudden you end up with you know no sticker whatsoever and then your whole year is going to look way way different and then you're gonna have to make a lot of changes so um that's St I know I understand like you you're you're you're one of the guys who was massively against the franchise leagues and I agree on a lot of the points why they suck but also there is the financial part that actually what that was like the whole uh leading idea of how why franchise semi franchise Le whatever you want to call them uh were were built was because of the fact there were so many Financial unknowns in the in the space and teams wanted to kind of collectively try to crack those issues didn't um now I want to I'm trying to find this tweet I don't think I'm going to be able to find it find it in time but after the these announcements came out from um valve about how things are going to change I swear oie made a tweet saying that there was still going to be like revshare from pro league to the teams who were playing in pro league yeah so but he was he was talking about I think the whole us Pro Tour but I could be wrong the whole protour um I mean because Pro Tour because the partner teams get some some Revenue share from the pro tour as well um depending on how I don't know I don't remember what's the exact things are but uh but that that might be the case but yeah I don't want to misquote because it's been a while since he released that tweet that was a while ago now wasn't it things things definitely change drastically in that well you guys are an ESO partner team now too is is that something that I guess the discussions now going forward is about winding that up this next year like 2024 is anything different or it's which is business as usual for 2024 and then 2025 would just cut it off um I believe so 2024 is going to be business as usual as far as I know uh don't quote me on this but uh then what happens beyond that is still all all up in the air I believe you know they there there is some kind of connection also with valve to kind of like not pack pedal but have a disc like have an actual conversation you know um of having different views like I'll just put this example out there from an NS perspective you know um I've always thought about this like if if we did if we were not a Louver team in the 2020 I don't think n would be here today in this shape and form whatsoever because when we were rebuilding the team for 2021 like that was the selling point we had that there's this backbone of the two proleague seasons of the year um like for example Snappy had a better deal out there in terms of money uh from another team um that he could have chosen to take but instead came to us to build a team um so if we would were not a partner team in ESL I think I think the history would be a lot different from an 's perspective after what happened in 2020 it's a bargaining chip with with trading players and stuff right because it's it's guaranteeing tournaments guaranteeing places for them to play which is where what they what they all want to do right they don't want to be  sidelined yeah I mean yeah there's Financial sides to it too right like teams are also uh giving part of the ref share to players as well so there's all always a monetary value to the to it as well okay so the the future is uncertain which is pretty normal but for the for the for the next year uh we are just going to go business as usual with uh well the thing that I like about next year um is the we get the the second major as the end of the season so we get to see how it functions like after we come out of the player break in the middle of next year uh which I think is in July sometime uh June to July then when we come out of that we that's then we have that run in we actually get the run in we get like an evenly split year and then we get to see what things are going to look like a little bit more with that in come 2025 obviously this means the ESL and blast are going to have to change the way they structure some of their events I think there'll be other players getting back in like this would maybe be an invitation for PJ to run something that's not a major maybe for starladder to start getting involved again if they're still around right so maybe we get some of these these ORS back in but again then this is where it becomes I guess for an org like a team then how do you pick events you're just picking the event that has the biggest amount of prize money so that like how how else are they meant to be able to incentivize you guys it's like also the quality of events like what what is given in terms of you know flying seven people having PRACK rooms I think that's all pretty standard these days but you have to go up to weighing things differently because the way it's been done for the last few years you know what you've been getting most of the time right yeah for sure I think it's kind of going back to the past uh through the times of when I was doing the talent stuff and I was always frustrated to how many different events there were going on at the time right and uh million different organizers trying to battle it out against one another trying to find space and you know I remember the best of times when I was flying home on a train 5:00 p.m. and then getting a check-in notification for next day next morning 5:00 a.m. for a flight to go to the next event because they were just everyone was ramming the calendar so that's kind one of the fears I have that this will get even more crowd that'll be more more fiercer fight in terms of um tournament operators and organizers and uh it becomes like an arms race in that sense but I guess positive fact is that we will have different operators having the opportunity to to put these events together uh so remains to be seen what are going to be the uh the selling points for these organizers I mean there's there's there talk behind the scenes and I like I don't want to read too much into it but I got the slight indic indication that there's going to be more control from from valve in terms of what that dynamic in from 2025 was going to look like just because I mean they said something along the lines of that they will have a certain rule set for all of their ranked events and it's not going to work as as it is now where the Val ranking includes everything that is effectively on hltv because we're the ones who are providing them all with all the data uh but that there will be some sort of a choosing process for what will constitute the ranked event for them and stuff like that so there's certainly going to be some level of control over that and and them being able to choose what's ranked event and if it's not then that's going to be also a bargaining chip for or rather whatever is a ranked event is going to be bargaining chip for the tournament organizer to be able to attract those teams right so like from that perspective I feel like there's there's definitely a plan for valve I don't know what it is exactly but there's certain talk out there that seems like there's going to be some some level of control from them over the over the circuit um we will see what that inails I haven't heard slightly monetizing for these TOS as well in a way because that's the thing if you're going to be selected as like an event then there needs to be some way for the too to look to monetize um in that now I don't know what model they could look to do that maybe more to what n was mentioning earlier I don't think we do the valve seem very against the pay-per-view stuff right they don't they don't really I remember in Dota we had that whole kickoff a couple years ago even when um some streams were getting dmca and and that's anyway um so they seem to want to keep it open so there has to be some way to put money back into the pockets of uh of the TOs but I remember I was having a chat with with valve this was a couple years ago and um I was like oh yeah there's got to be a way to help the TOs and the sentiment was well if we give them more money they're just going to spend it I was like oh yeah I guess I guess they are just G like it's not like it's going to put the it's not just going to put the books into black right they're not just going to go from like being in the red and being like Oh we have no money events made no money to just going oh okay well we have shitloads of M like that's that's not going to happen especially when you look at like these massive businesses like EFG ESL right they're doing everything under the Sun so even though I imagine Counter-Strike and DOTA well I didn't even off their money sinks I don't think that's even a fb's um surmise these days I don't think that's probably where they blowing their cash um all right do we have any yeah sorry yeah I mean I just wanted to bring the conversation back onto Anson like now that we're kind of in the future talk and all that stuff I mean we've spoken about the changes that have happened so far but I mean indication from behind the scenes is that that's potentially not the end of of of all changes and I'm curious if how much you can comment on what the future events is uh short term you know in terms of the lineup and leading into 2024 in this business you don't know what you wake up tomorrow for so anything can happen at any point in time to be to be fair with you but right now we have that Steam and yeah it's uh that's what we're going with so I mean there's nothing really more to say to it but yeah aort is is a business where uh you never know what's going to happen tomorrow he you go St does that answer your question I mean it answers my question I mean exactly what it is oh Prof are you okay you with us yeah bro it's a it's a hard out here no I have been like my microphone is not muted it was not muted but it got bugged so like I was trying to say I was trying to ask questions you know and I'm like is this Chad guy just cutting me off all the time like okay I'll wait for my next opportunity I do it again it's now Striker is talking I'm like okay what the and someone is sh you're muted and uh whoever that is was right that's that's amazing thank you all your questions I just wanted to ask uh I wanted to just rewind just a bit to the to the whole like uh valve thing that that Striker was talking about and ask Nat to how he feels about that concept of like valve having more safe on tournaments and stuff like that what's your like first instinctual thought about that my first instinct say is like they don't like why would they want that because they never want to even have a conversation like you send an email to to one of them they might respond if you're lucky and that's about it but like when have you ever had any conversation or like a back and forth with valve like it's just not a thing they say what they want to do and how they want to do it and you know that's the way it's going to go right so uh that concerns me as a fact that there is no relationship like at conversation that I'm aware of um because it would be great to actually be able to give uh the view from different angles there's always the different angle of from a to's perspective from a team perspective from a player perspective from an agent like there's you know there's a lot of different different parts of in this business that are making their livelihood through the game and they obviously have different type of issues or concerns um so it would be great to have one but uh I feel like it's going to be oneway Street yeah I mean it does seem uh essentially what Val whole ranking that takes into account prize money like as a big factor it just seems like yeah whoever pick puts in the more money that's better for the game because like bigger tournaments more to more to win right but I think that could almost like deteriorate some of the other things because people can be like okay what's the point of doing a 500,000 tournament and having all of the fancy stuff you know seven rooms and this and that when you can just like put that in the prize pool which will make it like a more worthy worthy valve ranking event which gets you the teams like this is all a lot of speculation but like it seems seems kind of a short sided very simplified approach that can have so many holes and like I I really dislike the the same thing that you're talking about like valve doesn't have the level of involvement never had to be that diligent about these events to really understand the differences and the nuances like ah this tournament should be here like they kind of do things pretty willy-nilly and I feel like that could be just end up being worse overall than than what we have right now um I think uh just another another thing because you're talking about kind of the the importance of having the the partner slot and like the revenue share that comes with that can you tell us like approximately for an for an ends team in the last two years what is where does the money come from like what's the what's the revenue share between like I can if I can guess it's like maybe 30ish percent is that kind of uh partnership revenues maybe some like small priz money cuts and stuff like that then there's like sticker money probably kind of the same and and then sponsorship kind of the same and then I guess like 10% maybe merch and other smaller stuff that that comes in I guess like player sales that kind of comes and go is not really a stable income and not something you can Bank your am I kind of close to to income yeah yeah no you are pretty pretty reasonably close to like where the revenue streams are uh for sure and we're always looking for the next pillar the next thing that we can we can try and build a bigger bigger pillar but uh yeah I mean for sure I in a in a sense it is a positive trend that it's less the commercial like sponsorships and partners that are uh the percentage of the revenue is getting smaller uh because there's a lot of variables but then when these type of variables uh well for example like the the stickers or like in-game Revenue digital items or whatnot um they they take a bigger portion there's of course like the the question mark always you kind of then uh becomes like a race that you have to be a part of the major you know to make keep your business profitable uh but is it a good or bad thing I could depends on who you are and what like which which angle you're looking at it from I for me it's fine you know it's part of the fun you know that you have to actually be competitive to to make the business work meritocracy and we love that yeah don't we lie that around here um all right here's just one one last thing I wanted to ask about uh it's just just came up to me that you guys have kept the exact same Academy team throughout I think ever since you started it is that right the exact same lineup right listen listen the fun fact is that it is the longest standing finish lineup since the 201819 lineup that made the cavich major final that is kind of cool I'm just curious about okay so like usually like the idea of Academy teams is like okay you bring some players you figure out if they are good enough either to make it to your main team or maybe good enough to sell to somebody else you know it is kind of like a farm thing in a lot of people's minds whether for your own purpose or for you know for other teams when you don't have spots on your main roster you know but obviously like this is not necessarily what you're doing because like you wouldn't keep the same five if you didn't have some sort of a plan for it so can you explain the philosophy behind the academy team the whole Academy program was basically like the it was an outcry for the fact that we there was no finished players that we could sign into our team right like we had to go International one point and uh even more so now we're in a situation where we have zero fin in our main main CS team uh uh and of course we feel sad about that fact we are a Finnish organization that's where we're from I'm finish you know everyone that most of us work at ends our finish um so we wanted to kind of start salvaging the Finish counter counter strike scene in the way that we give something for the youngsters to Aspire to be a part of um and the I think the Finish like in the big picture of finish Counter Strike is such a kind a long um ways um behind in the big picture that it feels like actually Fielding a tableall team and learning and teaching them uh in the long term makes a lot more sense there will be changes for sure at one point like it's evident but we also have a what we call a prospect Group which is if I'm not mistaken around 10 10 players which is like players outside of the actual lineup and then we consider those players also uh to maybe be part of the academy in the future I think for next year who knows you know maybe we'll make teams out of them uh things of that nature so and also there's one limiting factor in Finland right now that we cannot have kids under the age of 16 technically as part of the academy because of legislation the way those type of things go uh so we're kind of hindering ourselves as a nation as well not being able to get the 13-year-old kids the prodigies uh young like which would make a lot of sense to try to get into yeah exactly to get them into the professional environment to practice right and learn the ropes early um but yeah no I mean does that answer your question I'm not sure but yeah I mean just generally because like I it just hit me like I don't know a couple of days ago when I was looking into into the academy team I was like this is the same guys that I I did that feature around the academy team when you guys built it which is I don't remember which the which one it is now it's like a year and a half ago or something like that July 20 yeah 2022 yeah July okay so that is that is like that is pretty much the timeline you know and I was like that's that is very unique for an Academy team that does just doesn't exist anywhere else like you would look at any Academy team you want and basically every couple of months they changing rosters like there's there's very little retention of the players you know I'm curious how you like first of all how you justify that from the perspective of like do not have anybody from the prospect that could potentially come in to to make that team better or you know does nobody you know like for example potty you know has been a guy that's been putting up really crazy stats you know for for that tier like was he not good enough or was there not not a spot for him to make it to to the to the main team or you know to be sold off somewhere else and then you you know bring up somebody else you know to keep that rotation going you know to be able to to kind of have an impact on more players let's say I feels like it's just kind of ended up being this way because there has been interest from teams for various different players that have been the like numbers wise performing and maybe specialist roles you know uh hard to guess who who I'm talking about here for sure uh yeah there's been interest for sure and things could have turned out differently and then that would have caused a natural um uh rotation in the players uh for sure but it just hasn't panned out that way we've even considered that as would be would it be a good thing whether it's a good thing that they are sticking together or whether it's a good thing that we are shipping players to maybe another team or be loaning to somewhere or being sold to another team team whether it be Finnish or International um and it just kind of has worked out this way and um I don't like for me it's it's it's fine that we were we kind of committing a bit more long term into these these guys um and in the meantime having the prospects group also and we're going to be expanding that for the next year um and yeah I guess we're slow fins we just take our time slow steady wins the r yeah and then yeah of course like um someone like ptty for example a phenomenal player a talent for sure uh problem is he's an oper and you know we have a pretty good oper in our team right now so hard uh hard justification to you know move him to the main team and you guys you don't you guys don't seem like the type of organization who you know who would push your team to prefer finish players just because of your your heritage you know like it seems like you are trusting you were trusting at least in Marco and and saw you know and in their expertise yeah it's not the first thing you ask in a job interview when you come to an is to show us your bird shift certificate your passport you know your you go to the SAA and you know all of these other important questions of course we would love to have fins but yeah in the sauna in the well yeah in the SAA someone actually asked in chat like what about gyat and like why didn't you get him but like he was probably under 16 when he signed for Mouse Academy was like that like a factor he I think he was about to turn 16 and like we were putting together our Academy as he joined M NXT uh and we he was the first kid that we we we talked to so yeah for sure we wanted him to be a part of it but at the same time we had healthy really really good conversations with him as well and and uh mes NXT was you know they're the best Academy like they're Prov to like lift up players work out for him I said say yeah yeah yeah so we were like hey you know it makes sense we're still like we were not we didn't have a lineup at that point in time we had only hired a guy uh basically the academy at that point in time was like six or seven pages of PowerPoint that I had made and we had hired a person to start running the program so we were very early days we took six months to even get a lineup so that's I guess you know kind of goes to to this point I was saying that we're slow we take our time all right all right uh gentlemen are we call to shift into skire now is everybody happy with this everyone happy we can ask n two more questions as we go along all right all right uh Nat to you remember skin yeah I've I I've watched so yeah I I might need some all right well tonight under the bright lights uh sparkling like a print stream look at that we're doing a bit of product placement here as well Trad at. skire uh five questions multiple choice I did the questions this evening so some of them are tailored to you some of them are tailored to an uh some of them are tell to finish strike now these are going to get progressively harder as we make our way through 1 to5 uh are you ready to get things underway the people at home there already one step ahead type Trader in chat right now for your chance to enter the raffle how many questions natu gets correct will determine the skin uh value that we'll be giving away here today everybody ready um yeah should I have something open to actually do this uh I can do it for you you just tell me the answer and I can whack it in if you want or I can give you a link so it's up to you let me do you want the link is nice the link is nice okay okay there's the There's the link that's the link right there and uh yeah okay Striker Striker can give you a hand on a question or two if you want as well because he hasn't seen these so uh we we'll go from here okay Lucas are you ready yeah I'm ready good all right question number one lpus has been very vocal on Twitter about shorting what TSLA e G or the US dollar well um this is a pretty straightforward answer I'll just click it a Tesla uh now has Tommy met Elon Musk that's a good question if I would have to guess I would say yes yeah they they're probably best friends yeah okay and they still going down like that no I reckon they'd get along they go out for some some afternoon Walks Like robs he's still out bad from Twitter now that he lost mod musk actually owns the the company you know it's that that's suspicious to me yeah yeah that's a good point actually he did take a tweet tw Twitter private though oh he oh that's why I was searching for his Twitter I couldn't find it ah okay and it's just at Tommy now at least it was I couldn't find him I was I was looking for him I couldn't find him all right uh okay that's question number one done and dusted let's move on to question number two Es so1 C to qualify natu who couldn't attend it duude to his wedding who stood in was it angel dust nasu or zti I mean I know the answer but I'll ask you guys like whoever that hasn't seen the uh it's it be huh was nasu uh negative okay I mean it wasn't angel dust then yeah you mean it wasn't angel dust Source Legend mhm yeah actually an also a a co-founder of uh but yeah it was sarta who then also played the major instead of Alo okay I remember I remember Anders hyping him up a lot on the cast this is this is my memory of of this this player in this tournament yeah if natu didn't if natu didn't uh go to his wedding and came to the qualify then we might not have actually qualified for the major so thanks for going to your wedding Nat to appreciate that and the funny part is that we didn't even play until Sunday my wedding was Saturday so I could have technically just flown over right play  now well you didn't they that took down you boys well not you well you went there and pimp with uh with dig or whatever it was at the time um so that was that that's why I got this one in here wanted to have a little bit of a shout out to myself you know inflating the ego more and more uh okay question number three who was the last finished player to compete on 's starting roster was it yampi doto or Alo uh I believe it would be dodo right so because well I mean yumy left when the international team happened Al left at the beginning of Summer 2021 or was it maybe Springtime so I think yeah yeah so delto would be the answer I don't know if I've done too if these are too easy I like literally there doing the moves sometimes you know so it's hard it's hard not to yeah but you know that was a couple years ago for me I can't even really remember what I did yesterday so I it's it's interesting that he's you know the recall is there it's great and we're getting older too the brain start to have a bit of wear um okay question number four n verse phase in Dallas semifinal map three ancient how many rounds were played 54 59 or 64 these questions are going from zero to 500 I love it yeah no I was remember watching this map and I moved thank God I moved to my bed with my laptop to watch it for the third map um uh but I wasn't it 59 rounds am I am I imagining this I mean that would have been 3128 right I think that that seems like it's very plausible to me I feel like that that was the number but I'm not so sure yeah I'm I'm just going to lock it in cuz that was my intuition telling me so I trust my intuition feeling yeah okay all right well you are correct four out of four and smash that one as well it was 59 magnificent rounds of Counter Strike and that was the that's the fun Counter-Strike I hope we still get with an go on for because that type of a game was fantastic I loved watching that that's that's what it's about the slobber knockers all right uh we're going to stick with numbers here for question number five this one here is uh probably the difficulty level too too high but we'll see how we go so question number five average age of new ANS roster is 24.5 25.8 or 26.7 I haven't looked this up I have no idea I can tell you glaive is younger than Snappy I'm aware of that yeah he's like what five five years younger that's actually 28 yeah yeah yeah but Marco looks like he's 19 so um I wow I mean the rest of the guys are pretty young so I have I literally have no clue I literally I have no clue I I need some help here unless you you might as well just whatever your person is around what 20 23 is De is 25 26 uh who do we have um Maden is around 25 yeah maybe 25.8 would be and then who's the last 5 Seconds yeah I'm just going to go 25.8 ah they got feelings they've done it again 25.8 the correct answer that's five from five competi comes falling the lights are spinning around the people can't

we got some hot topics here to discuss this evening A lot's happening A lot's been happening uh all the time this is quite a tumultuous period as far as changes and ups and downs and people getting benched and uh yeah all of that good stuff is concerned and it feels like it's not going to stop for a little while longer when we have a few more confirmations coming through the pipeline um but let's let's get straight in with the some of the the meat and potatoes Prof when we come over for the award show will there be room for me to play counter strike somewhere or do I need to go to a different boot camp facility if you want it I'm sure the reload guys will be able to hook you up I think you won so and if nothing else just call call up go go to yonko's bedroom to play see there we go there'll be multiple places I'll just go to Yo's house maybe I go to cassad and Jo I can join his new team um that's some news that came out when yes yeah I I think I might be above the age range actually and an AA maybe I do two for one no but we I guess we can quickly top that one off at the start here uh cassad becoming the head coach over there at bleed now I don't really know a lot about bleed um I see that there's an article that has been well an interview that has come out here I haven't had the opportunity to be able to read that just yet is anybody able to tldr this bleed situation it's good that cassad has found himself a a scenario to get stuck into I have not have not read it can't say I've read it um I opened it and I saw it was it was intimidatingly big so I went for the glaive one that was that was shorter uh and more topical more needed with a with a ends discussion uh but it is it's interesting it's um I think a tricky job not really you know people people will be on kad's ass now that he was kind of a pretty outspoken Talent member just in general especially with eg you know so so if he doesn't do well I'm sure uh people talk trash but uh he is not now building a European team from what I understand so I think this is gonna be uh it's a lot about the players that he gets you know uh we I don't know I can't really judge him unless he gets like something really good and it doesn't work out um is there potential is there is of course so I think that's kind of where where I'm I'm I'm looking to see this op igl that he's looking for and after that we can get a good feeling of where the project is going yeah I mean he said spend some money he said something about you know like having the plan to build a team for uh and for it to be able to compete in about a month's time which you know he even admitted is kind of close in terms of the major qualifiers so it seems like this project is more for after that at least you know it would be probably pretty unrealistic to to expect that team to be able to qualify like off the bat um so I mean if you have zero contracts signed with like one month left into the year you know you're probably not going to be so it's not going to be so easy for you to be able to compete at the major so um all that makes sense I mean he was just talking about kind of building a a and a structure that's everybody buys into you know and that's why the Opera kind of combo is the first coming in you know I think uh fairly like reasonable approach he said that he had like an opera in mind or like some operas in mind that that that he's about to talk to so I'm curious about who that could be um because I'm not yeah I'm not aware of any any of those options you know I don't think shirou is in in the realm of possibilities for for him and he's like one of the big ones just uh yeah correct he says uh it doesn't specifically mean we're going to for five EU players but the core will be European for now so uh I just don't know I don't know much about bleed as an or but my kind of what I the feeling that I got is that they do have money that they're that they're kind of an or that is willing to spend so um it's going to be interesting to see how that pans out because as as Striker you say there's not there's not going to be a lot of free agents that are like top tier talents at the same time hanging around even if you go down to the tier three you're probably paying a buyout of some sort especially for some of the players that are kind of more more hyped I don't know yeah I mean he he spoke about the Ambitions like kind of v in somewhat weak terms but he said uh D I was just looking to to to go back to see the the actual quote but I was going to say you know he's not the type of guy andec especially when he's been talking about like how he would build teams different differently he's always been kind of focused on winning and how much like on that sort of ambition and he pretty much reiterated that in the interview he said I'm not going to predict that we will be Champions immediately but people know I don't care about mediocrity I will always aim to at least be a contender you have to be realistic first and we have to go step by step to get to the level we're looking for so I mean at least long term he wants to be a contender right short term is probably not realistic because of the the lack of I mean considering the space that it is now you know a lot of teams are already looking for like a lot of the big players but it seems like even from what bra was saying that's that seems to be at least around the case you know that they can build a team that that is going to be competitive okay well uh yeah I'll have to do a little bit more reading about that and see where we go Nat you got anything you want to say about bed um no I just I mean it's cool to see cassad back on the back on the saddle in my opinion like he's been off of it for quite a quite some time I felt like um I was always wondering like he has a lot of strong opinions on Twitter or X whatever you want to call it nowadays for sure uh but I kind of like it he has a for me like he seems the kind of guy that I've always kind of wondered like hey someone should give him an opportunity to be like a GM type of a figure you know um like like he's saying he's not in it for the mediocrity so I think he would be good at whipping people to make them work for the money uh so yeah know it's interesting to see like how much uh kind of power does he have in this project as a as a as a coach uh and I think in this sense like they're starting the right way to build a Counterstrike team to find a strong Figure Head now I think the next would be getting a solid igl that he can connect with and kind of see eye to eye uh in terms of play style in terms of players and this and that and then yeah the Opera is a very very big role to fill also so yeah I think this is actually a pretty solid approach they have now it's just all about execution I think kasad is under so much pressure Kad is under so much pressure with this team just because of how he's been running his mouth around like how he would build teams better and all the EG stuff you know that he's been so salty about not getting the keys to that roster and all that stuff so it's just going to be exciting like I love this story because like he's been the guy who has who has said a lot of things about how other teams were run and and how kind of insinuating he'd do the job better so now he actually has to do the job better otherwise you know will get ridiculed for it so I'm all here for that well it's uh it's entertainment right so he's bringing it to us in one way or another you know so he's he's he's set the situation up for himself and now we get we get to see the entertainment side unfold with with what type of Team he gets to put together all right let's jump into uh talking about G2 now uh G2 have added Nexus to the roster the jks benching uh official as well at that point and uh you look at the team okay Prof you see Nex to join what are you thinking to yourself you're going yeah okay okay this is cool n it's like okay and it's fine isn't it it's this is fine it's okay it's it's not fine it does not make any sense honestly like I'm I'm waiting to if s's joining as the coach I'm a little bit more excited okay that maybe that excit got nothing to do with Nexa but yeah that's a that's a hypothetical right there um I want to say that it doesn't like I'm just waiting for more like I'm I can't see this being the whole thing like if this is the whole thing then it's like one of those you know when you watch a movie and you know the plot is like it's like a mystery or like what's going on in this movie it's like it can be this but it's too obvious it's so dumb you know it can't be this then you go the there's like so many turn arounds and it's like yeah it was that thing the whole time you're like this like what is this you know that's how I feel I feel like there has to be something smarter than just like we replaced jks with how what kind of a  move is that what what does that accomplish in any world like was jks a problem player no you can't say he was you can well the story The Story Goes that he wasn't vocal enough right that's that's That's How The Story Goes that is fair I can understand that that's that's part do you not have enough vocal players on G2 like as it is like you have niiko Hunter and hookie and you think like and it's not like modesty is like going to be super quiet like of course he's the guy who like takes a lot of the a lot of the feedback on board like from what we've been talking about but like this is not a team that needs another big personality you know so from that perspective I'm not sure if I agree with that being necessarily a problem you know could be like to do with atmosphere or whatever like people have also said that that like he looks too negative on camera all the time like to to I don't know not expressing his emotion guess I guess yeah but I don't see that as like the sole reason for like there being problems would fit in a finish team but like okay okay you want someone that's more you know you want someone that's more like like boom on on na'vi you know you want just like a jolly guy or something okay but but is Nexa that guy and is Nexa like can you find a player that's like kind of similar in skill level but also adds that like I feel like this is a massive downgrade individually and then like to some degree an upgrade maybe in like Vibes you know Vibes maybe in Vibes but it is a big deal Vibes are a big deal also have other players on the team that like ah I don't know for for me it's notal with your own profit if you can use someone else's a scapegoat and then bring someone else in to fix those problems isn't that the best way to do it the only I can only be on bar with this if it's also like a a hooky move for someone else and then like that balance that you make two changes that kind of make sense together but I think this in itself is just like a downgrade it's just a downgrade I mechanically speaking it's a downgrade yeah but I'm just curious about how much that will affect Nexa because I mean you could see that the fact that he went into iname leading has taken toll on him as as it would on pretty much anybody you know like it's not as it does to everybody I mean that's the point you know and now but the PO like the problem I see with that is like this has like now been what like over two years since he's done that uh and there was like a period of of G2 where he wasn't in game leading and he was in game leading again and all that stuff and there was like a massive mess around it and it was very clear that he didn't want to do that but he kept doing that for another year with o or like however long it was like a year and something with OG um even almost two years or something with OG and uh somehow like after all that time we're supposed to expect him to go back to the level where he was like before he was an in-game leader and all that stuff like I think there's it is a big gamble you know and it's like I think people now underestimate JK's kind of uniqueness in that role I don't think the the role that he was win was was was easy and I think he was still even in the times where where G2 weren't the most competitive like he was still one of the better players in that slot because the anchor rle is is one of the most difficult you know to be able to put up big numbers in and he was still averaging somewhere above 1.0 1.05 you know or something like that so I think you know it's not it's not an obvious up upgrade if anything it it's a it is a big G gamble in terms of individual output do you want him natu do you want Justin I can get him on the phone I wake him up now do you need a I mean you never know right like I said you never know if I wake up tomorrow we need players um but no on this like I'm taking my boring business hat in my head again and I'm thinking what if you know listen what if uh Nico squeezed in like this is the way he played the game he squeezed in uh so so much of the uh of the budget uh with this whole Falcons charade that uh G2 were uh forced to make make a move with another player and get some of them for less money maybe this is a a budget move who knows like there's no there's no way that NEX would be getting paid the same amount of money as jks I I would you think it would be l no 100% would be less like wouldn't market value of us would yeah for sure so I'm just you know I'm just throwing that out there but you know this I mean it also depends like I mean this also relies on first of all what JK's contract looks like and like is it worth having him on the bench for I don't know when did he join like was uh like he's got to have at least what he like another he has like another year on his HP yeah never mind you've yeah yeah I was talking I was talking did you say that no I mean he has to have at least another year right because he he got signed in August 2022 and there's no AJ like he would they would have signed him for less than two two years and so like if you risk having him on the bench for like a year out of that of course you're hoping to sell him right but I don't think that the difference in salary is going to be that massive to be such a big factor you know I don't know what happened in G2 like I don't have the info I'm as confused as everybody is about this H and like the the stuff that I have heard I don't believe so like and I don't even want to share it because it's like I've heard different things so like as long as I don't have it corroborated I don't want to share it so that's like that's my point like I have no clue what to think about this or what to see as a reasoning you know because I also don't buy into the story that it's all about Nico and and him wanting to have a balcon team you know because like I know niik has gotten a lot of for for some of the stuff that he did but it's also like way too much but he's also like I know for a fact that what he's saying is not is also true you know he he didn't always have all the say in terms of like what roster moves were happening and stuff like that I know that the stuff that happened with Nexa that he was in game leading like all of that was like kind of the orgs doing and like Malik had a lot of saying that when he was the coach and all that stuff you know like I know that there wasn't just like Nico puppeteering behind the scenes you know so from that perspective you know even with the detail that he was just about to leave to Falcons and suddenly like everything turned around I don't think like it was contingent on Nexa joining the team you know I feel like I don't know it just doesn't compute to me like I like Nico is still a very competitive guy and and um he wouldn't do something just because of friendships or whatever he would do something to be able to win more right so I don't I just I just don't understand the situation I really don't no I I agree with that sentiment I think that like the amount of framing that Nico gets that is some like Puppet Master Mastermind that's controlling like everything I think that's like I don't think he's he's doing that at all I think his influence is very strong like I think that the influence of Nico and you wanting to keep him in the team especially with a player of his caliber like that all makes sense and the influence that that type of player could have on maybe something that natu is speculating about like hey we got to take you know we got to rob Peter to pay Paul right okay well you know that that you can understand then maybe cuz jkss would make more money than a Nexa we need to get a little bit out there but I agree I agree with the the sentiment as well of like this this NEX thing I don't know if Nico is gone this has to be the coast I need to play with NEX why the  would like where's that come from like it's just you know it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't add up to me at all that that would be the the decision so um I I don't I've read a lot of stuff course we have natu here and who he could say if m is also joining the team you know no I mean aren't they like building this the next Balon super team right that's the whole thing right so you would need mod for that you would need mod for that for sure definitely and I think they've been teaching Mony Serbian so he's going to count anyway they're just going to bring him across change the flag away he goes uh look I I I went I did another podcast last night and I uh I said some things like yeah there's a few few headlines a few threads one of the things I want to point out because I I understand English Second Language and I talk fast and I get like emotional about things but one thing I want to point out is there was some misconceptions in a couple of the hael TV threads that I tried to um I tried to get ahead of but people are just going to read that guy's commment and just go with it there was one of them I think it's called um Sponge G2 leaks and in it he says jk just learned he was benched through H TV's report now I would I would like people to go and listen to the podcast with what I was saying so you get the context of it I want to point out that that that I didn't say that and that's not the case Justin did not learn that he was benched through HL TV's report that's that's not true what is true is him not being communicated to by his management for weeks at a time after Sydney that that is true that's that's bang on true um he was essentially ghosted so um that that went on for a while because I was talking with Justin back and forth um about trying to work out what he was going to do when he was going to go home um and then I think you know after the first like week and a half of no replies we like okay well just you're probably you're probably getting benched at this point um because if no one's talking to you then uh that that says a whole lot right that the silence is deafening um but in in in terms of of that um yeah I I don't like again like I'm obviously going to be biased because Justin's my friend so we we have that as the starting point people can take that as they want I don't care that they benched him I don't give a like that that is no skin off of my nose I don't I don't care whatever I just don't like the treatment of it all because I think it's I I I I can put myself in two minds I can go one he's a player for this team and he does what he's told I can go the other and I can go he's a player for this team he's come in they've won a couple of big trophies together they're benching him we're going into the next major cycle have a bit of decency to give this guy a heads up so he can start looking and talking to people and trying to make some plans for himself because you look right now at where JS can go and there's not too many places that jkss can go and that might not have been any different if the news had come out earlier um or if he maybe but maybe it would have been if he could have gotten into those conversation so we we never will really know um I just think that leaving a player out in the lurch like that while doing all the back room dealings and I get that Nico would have been the priority dealing with that back and forth and I guarantee there would have been moments where he was going to Falcons and he's not going to Falcons and that's going to be difficult for the management to deal with and then trying to work out what roster they're going to build around that because there were also other moves that were meant to be going on um within G2 the team was essentially like done and dusted for a moment there and then now they retained four of the five players um so yeah it's it was an interesting time over there at G2 and I'm curious to see how they recover from from here it's they're not really I don't really feel like they Dro down too far I think losing JS is a is a blow but I don't think Nexa isn't going to be able to fill somewhat of the Void so you know far as it goes rwise it is a good fit because like that's yeah like JK's roles are I mean js's positions are pretty much his preferred roles you know so I think like one for one it makes perfect sense in terms of the players you know yeah yeah no for sure I don't really have a lot more to say about this I don't want to get animated and stuff you know you did that already why don't you why don't you save some of that juice for for the podcast that actually pays you that would be nice well the thing is you know that that that look I offered to do this one yesterday but Striker couldn't make it so we had to move it to choose true I couldn't do oh okay  it's I'm just I'm just talking for a bit but now I think uh jks he should find a team I think he should find a team I honest agree honestly think Vitality could have been an option I think it was wasn't going to be an option I I don't think that was their yeah because they were looking for Hunter for some reason which I don't think made sense but okay uh they went for Mesi I think jkss could have fit there pretty okay I think I think Mesi is a pretty good fit too yeah he is he's not he's not bad uh I think their first Target was twists that is also what I yeah that's also a bit of the Rumor Mill pretty much pretty much sure I mean like it it just was like that was one of one of Twist's options you know when when he was like considering between like either staying at phas going to liquid or or like other other options like his contract was just about to run out so obviously he had a lot of different uh teams coming knocking at his door I'm sure yeah and then I mean heroic need a whole new team if they go International then you know if there's a good mix of players there then then why not if if hands lose some players jks there that's also a good good fit so I think he's going to bounce back somewhere I think it's going to be pretty pretty solid honestly even even liquid maybe could have could have found a spot for him um could have been an option maybe who knows but uh I think he's going to be okay I think he's going to be okay it just is pretty unfortunate to to waste time in a kind of a weird transfer period for sure okay uh should we jump forward do we want to talk about fnatic let's do it so from ship management to more ship management uh so Dexter was benched over on uh fnatic well fnatic suck like we had Khan on this show he just talked in circles man like I like what are we talking about fnatic haven't been good in what the better part of half a decade now like what what what that's five years for those you playing at home by the way actually like 2018 did they win in something in 2019 they won an online event in in the there was pro league the first pro league in Co yeah yeah yeah but they they haven't been good in such a long time and they just keep making like terrible decisions as far as rosers are concerned and I'm not say not saying Dexter was a good decision for fnatic to pick up I think that probably was another bad decision that they had made right there again like this whole again I'm going to be biased towards the Aussies I can you know but I don't think that that Dexter to ftic was even a good move for Dexter I think it was just a move right they need he needed to go somewhere after the whole the whole M situation um and now they've just made another house roster like what what are we do what are we doing why are we just burning money why don't we the The Swedish Thing at least excited me because there would have been some identity to it let just keep building mediocre International rosters I mean to be to be fair you know like if you're a team that's that's not doesn't have the money to make all the moves you're going to have to go for some of these players that are either cheap or like are on the are up and coming and so they don't they don't have some like big power to to have some big contracts you know or to even have a big buyout attached to them you know so like going for a guy like M for example I mean he's been he's been putting out pretty pretty big numbers there was a lot of rumors that his contract was also super expensive you know for the team that he was playing with and I know that Czech teams have been unreasonable as hell between each other you know like and basically like preventing players from moving between each other so I'm curious about how that turned out you know but still like I kind of understand where fnatic is going now at least because before that they were going just for people who um who let's say kind of that who wear some names but maybe weren't some names like weren't the names that you would go if you're looking to build to the future you know and like if you're a fanatic and you don't have the money for big players you're going to have to do some scouting and you're going to have to pick up some players that have you know future potential and and aren't like necessarily proven at the moment you know so it's more like about this uh this body move that I'm curious about just because I mean he's going to go back to in game leadership as far as I can understand um and um and how much that's going to make sense you know because I don't feel like like for me I don't I don't understand why Dexter's gone after two months you know or three months or whatever it is that that he's been on that roster I think it's probably good for Dexter to get out of there and you're Dex do you think you're gonna have you're gonna have a lot of offers I don't I don't know if that's the point you know like I don't think he's gonna have a lot of off like if he's gonna have an offer like it could be like n OG you know like or something like that you know just another team that's basically the same deal you know like it's just it's not going to make a difference they're also not going to spend money and it's just not going to be run as good as he probably would hop so like at the moment I'm just not sure whether there there was a good move for Dexter well yeah that that's the thing I don't imagine him being bench was was his choice but the thing with that fanatic roster that we were talk about was the age of it it was an old team right with Roy with with Grims with Dexter all of them chasing down that big three so um it was always a team that had a short lifespan and I'm not like I don't even think the old the old roster was good but natu I want to Pivot to you here fnatic are one of the teams to me that feel like Esports winter is not going to be too kind to them I know they're like a legacy name and stuff I just it doesn't feel like a strong they don't feel like they have a strong foundation in anything they winning in anything what are ftic even doing let me have a they they had a good valerant theme yeah they have a good valerant theme um so yeah games yeah it's tough tough for me to say of course like but like I can just speculate but I guess you know it feels like maybe the focus is not in Conor strike as much you know just judging from the the way that they're operating in the game uh at the same time you know I I'm always a fan of people also giving opportunities to players that are not necessarily uh highlight you know big super big signings but then again you would kind of wish for a brand like fanatic then also have the big signings on top of it but then yeah if you combine those two things I think would be the a great thing but uh having having a team poor crims by the way he's been around for a long time and has just had teammates changed left right and Center for how long has it been uh so it's like nine years old together yeah geez well oh gosh yeah that's a that's a career that's a career right there yeah I mean I like for actually for once like at least I can see where ftic is coming from because as you said before you know Roy was a guy who's 28 now when he got signed wait is he is he 30 already I think Roy is 30 I he's at least okay okay he's 30 so he was 29 when he got signed even you know so obviously you know this is not a guy that's gonna stay on top of his career um for a long time and like now they signed a guy who's 18 in QB and I think Mattis is 20 or 21 or something and like for Mattis I'm actually really really glad just because he's been the guy who's been like on the radar for a long time just hasn't been able to make the move up so and he was definitely like one of the players who was just the next from the tier two you know to to to make a move to like one of these teams who are um either like a partner team or at least like making you know making it through those qualifiers being a little bit more competitive so like I don't hate this from fnatic I really don't I think it's there's there are some likes to this in the fact that they have made this roster much much younger and you know building toward towards the future more I may I say something that might upset you Chad actually it's a question it's a question okay I like like do you like fanatic's roster or np's roster more and I can tell you I like Fanatics roster they're go right yeah and it's kind of the same if I was picking teams that don't really know what they're doing there's like three of them OG nip and fanatic they kind of live together as these teams that just like don't make good teams like that they they're my three I kind of cluster them to because I'm talking to Justin about what options are like you're not going on one of these three teams manate you are not I'm not letting you go here to die like what are we even talking about that crowd so hell yeah they're going to taint your perception of the entire world don't go there just stay the away better off building an oz team than going there that's that's the actual consensus like better off going to an Australian team than playing for one of those three yeah at least you have you know the internal fire and also if you're good and the team is you can still quit and then get another opportunity and be like well he was just on a shitty Australian team and you know go back but I think I think nip nip are they're kind of bad but they're this this roster change stuff didn't really inspire me I feel like they're just like going down a bit and Fanatics going up a bit that's how I see it they're both still not great teams but the it just makes a bit more sense um and I guess nip is also going to make more changes maybe not right away maybe in the next you know maybe after the next major but this is not you know it's not a finished product it's not doesn't have anything I think if nip picked up someone like this Mattis guy I think that would be better I don't know anything about him but he's kind of the profile of a player you would want on an IP like someone that's young and exciting and maybe proves to be something and not just the same old as I mean he has he has kind of like oper numbers for not being an oper and he's kind of an aggressive rifler so like from that perspective like all that stuff you know like it just makes a lot of sense for him to move to move up so I don't know I I'm I'm glad to see him uh you know make it to the to the big leagues all right let's keep this uh train chugging along aralis have uh officially announced the signings of uh yabi and stown yes Prof I don't know I'm just I'm just enjing this I'm still just enjoying this it's just giving so much it's giving every day did you see guys the whole situation yeah it's it's just it's just giving it's giving like I just want comment on this whole charade is like the way heroic has been acting on social media is like a kind of a crazy ex-girlfriend who's hasn't got an over her boyfriend and it's just like posting about him all the time it's like anything I go to like Twitter Instagram Tik Tok whatever it's always this heroic something about australas can we can we stop this already and just you know continue our lives no we can't they have that they they are they have been this really disruptive force in their life natu right they they you they're sending the they're sending the text you know every couple of months you think they're just getting over the break up and they send that text every couple of months and then it just starts up again that infatuation maybe there's a oh I shouldn't hear the table maybe there's a chance you know and then they're back in and they're thinking oh man because it keeps coming back like aralis have been plaguing heroic for forever like Hero's entire reason to coming together was to take that number one spot they took it you thought they were good you thought they were in a great place guess what guess what ASR aren't going anywhere they' been here the whole time it's always been asales and now they've been able to take you know two star players it's heroics they were the best Danish team and now they're not even the third best Danish team they're not even a team they don't even have five players exactly exactly dad you just reminded me of this Mee where it's like you know a guy looking at the at at the Earth from the Moon and there's like always has been you know the guy behind him with the gun or whatever that's literally that's literally the situation precisely australas are going to have control of this forever just the name value right you know the and it works out nicely as well Striker because the St the Stars they're in space so it all it all kind of comes full circle when you think about it from that fet but um are we are we excited for this team so buzz buzz is gone stair is saying how do we feel about this roster because I think that aalis have actually been making good moves um in recent times like it's not the aalis that was floundering and trying to hold on to to Legacy pieces you've got some really really good names now around that uh that have Vice like blame obviously beast mode St in the mix yabi as well like and if St can live up to any of the potential that we thought he had over there on Sprout all right we're cooking we're cooking with gas like this Australis roster could be could be really good what what is what's the general consensus on this one gentlemen man St is going to get all the rules isn't he he's just going to get he's going to get screwed I think in this because he was never like the guy who was going to run in first all the time even in Sprout like when he was pretty good I know that he like his numbers in ASR even in positions where he was um set up a little bit better weren't good um but it's just I think it's just going to tank him more and they even implied that they he was going to change some roles and it has to be in front like there's no way you will put like stown in front or yabi who has never been really aggressive you know like they all they're both kind of bity and like I I'm just worried about the roles in astres because like when they actually made the move before this when they when they brought in St and and borup it wasn't like some amazing signings like yeah St I had some bigger hopes before than he turned out to be but at least it made sense from a role perspective you know like at least you had a good balance of aggression there weren't so many people who um who clashed in in roles as it was before you know when glaive was part of that roster and zipx and all that like we were constantly complaining about like this team just doesn't make sense like you don't have like there's not enough space to be taken you know and I feel like they're going backwards with this even though it is like the two BG better performance from from heroic um and it's St who like as I'm sure have had their eyes on for ever like it feels like at least instead of one of them it should have been like a tus you know who's going to be able to be the guy who takes a lot of space who's going to be in front he was already fulfilling that role a lot in heroic like who were set up more in like a super pack you know that they were like constantly rotating together and they were like switching positions a lot like in terms of who was going in first and all that stuff but I just I just don't know how this team is going to work on tside especially CT side I can imagine you know that there's going to be enough because blamef is pretty aggressive on CT side you know it's not going to be a problem to make them fit together but T side I just don't know I question you said at the start st's going to get or just throw him in first just L to the slaughter on the T side and on the CT side just give him all the anchor rolls it's gonna be oh why St bad replace him for I don't know whoever the star player in the second best danger team is like it doesn't make sense like you're not really but like are you going to put St as a lurker like on the side or is it going to be blamef because blamef has moved into the the pack because of in game leadership right and that makes perfect sense like you kind of have to be Central to be able to Be an Effective in game leader right so is St just going to like transition into lurking instead of being the second guy in as he was before like transition you know so is like is St and yabi now going to be on the on the extremities and then like d device blame of stair is the is the pack you know like that's what I'm bring second voice right then I guess he could play the pack stuff with stair and device and then blame could right it could would be the pack guy yeah because if he's going to be a vocal component in the team he because you also have to think about the dynamic they had in heroic right so obviously everybody did everything for sure yeah yeah and they needed to be because Kon was oping and he can't obviously be doing the same things with the awp is what you can have a rifle do and so they could be possible I think that they have this is the one thing if you pick up a heroic player from the cadan era they're a malleable player right like they they could they could they're Jacks of all trades you know uh they can do whatever you really need them to do I think that is also pretty cool because you get your secondary Orin down as well for the team so you you you feel that kind of void as well so I actually think it's a I I'm excited for this estris I know that there are conversations about the roles but I think they should be a to like they should be able to work through I think they have players that can do a bit more I worry um like I think the biggest one blame is obviously aggressive on the CT side as you've just said as long as he's not in a position where he has to sacrifice on the T side because I think that will come with indecision and maybe slow things down a little bit but yeah yeah anyway I don't know I mean I hope you're right because I feel like I don't want to see stal change roles too much because he was effective in what what he had I don't think that he wouldn't be capable of being on on extremities you know but generally speaking like he's his the biggest success from him came came as like the second guy in he was the guy who was being the most set up in heroic even in a kind of very dynamic system you know so I wouldn't want him to suddenly like change all roles just because of of blamef being on the team so like I hope you're right about this and I could actually see it happening because otherwise I don't really see how this thing will work um without everybody like changing around a lot no I think the interesting part about this uh is apparently it was an insane buyout though like pretty insane from everything yeah like okay like I don't want to put out numbers but very high very very like for the two of them together like pretty pretty huge which is weird because that's not the vibe we were getting and not what Australis usually does uh but yeah I I think that's uh it's an interesting thing because it if it's true then it allows heroic to make big moves even though they lost like their team they could you know reinvest that through other players and stuff like that so I I think that's kind of an interesting thing to keep track of and see how the rest of the transfer season develops essentially because yeah if if they did end up paying so much because there is a major coming up and all these things and there are months and months on the contract left for these two guys then uh that's not the greatest business ever made especially if the roles are not good that's why I just doesn't make sense to me that there it wasn't a shush or Tes you know on on this lineup because I think it would just make the team play better just like we saw when borup was pretty bad on the team but the the results improved I feel like they're going to take another step back before improving again uh and that for a huge cost you know I mean I mean that has to be kind of like a move of desperation from asral as well and just from this from perspective of you know they're selling their their LCS spot and know only I think they're going to keep ownership of a part of it or something through a company or but I think most of it is going to to a different company so that's where they got the money to spend on this I'm I'm assuming um because I mean like I am willing to put out the number there because I've I've heard it from enough places to actually be be confident in it but it is like in the area of 2 million like between one and a half and 2 million of for for the two players combined yeah that's money from the last major it's all gone I mean yeah Bas basically that's a nice christm bonus for someone yeah but I mean that's that that supports the idea that hero now do have some some money to spend around then obviously you know they're changing ownership and uh and probably have the money to spend compared to the previous version you know so like from that perspective I mean yeah for sure but like it does it does sound like a like a move of desperation vers draws also because you know they're not going to have the the presence in other games as well you know so now CSS will be their biggest Focus 100% I mean it's always been like their best team you know or like the their their biggest team along with the League of Legends roster you know but now that's a part of the other the other part is gone you know that's that's where they have to survive you know if if Counter-Strike doesn't work out if there's another major that they don't make it to that is that is effectively like that is their lives you know like that they cannot afford to do that because they missed out on on a massive major you know damn okay well a little bomb show right there all right all right natu um do you got any feelings about this this Australis roster what do you the conversation at the beginning all of this was that someone correct me when I'm wrong because I know I won't be correct here um like yabi and Stam were going to be signed with Australis after their contracts with heroic were ending anyway is that what is that the case have I Mis have I misinterpreted something here one can you repeat that one more time so weren't they weren't they linked with astralis for when their heroic contracts were ending anyway I mean no no no no because they did not actually they didn't do the the thing where that asres does usually like where they signed them ahead of time um because you can't you can't actually do that until it's like six months uh ahead of their contracts ending and it was more than that um so uh I don't know like I don't know everything about I'm not a lawyer I can't really speak to to how this was set you're not a lawyer what are we anyway anyway like as I understand it like did it that's uh like I'm sure you know if if they waited it out if they waited out another few months you know they would have actually done that once they were able to but they didn't do that this time because as far as I can understand they weren't actually able to do that uh just because you do have to wait until it's like six months until their their current contract ends so um I mean that's uh it's just they had to pay a lot you know to be able to get them in they even wanted to get them in in terms of for the four final but blast blocked the move because it wasn't it was against their rules and I have to again I know I said this last time and but I do respect Blast for this because it was a copen agen tournament and you know if there was an astralis with st and yabi and that was their first tournament you know that would have created a lot of hype helped them sell out the arena I know for potentially if they made it far enough you know so like there was a lot of motivation for blast to Skirt the Rules a little bit then they didn't do that so again I'll give them props for a second episode or R because that's how I feel about it nice okay uh anyway Nat you got anything you want to say about asales uh yeah I mean uh it kind of feels like it's been eternity since we've not or we've had like there's always been like some kind of a caveat when it comes to chares there's some always being like this one part or two parts this or that a player here or there that just kind of has been like okay let's see where this is going to go you know it's been the Opera a bunch of times and uh some of the academy players along the line finally it feels like this is a lineup that's actually sort of like a final form version uh that you can get excited for uh and just looking at the name value like this is for sure should be a a team that has the capability of of being one of the one of the best for sure uh it's going to be fun to see how it actually actually pans out but for sure I think you guys are on the money in terms of why if the if you know hypothetically if the buyouts were as big as you were saying Striker uh it's the pressure it's the fact that it's the whole major that's coming up uh in a few months time you don't want to go into another major C cycle limping with a lineup that it would eventually change you know so you you bite the bullet uh you take the hit um you know the relationship with the with the team who has those contracts is not the best so you always know there's going to be a bit of a there's going to be a price tag that is maybe bigger for stalis than it would have been for another team um and so I mean obviously they had the capital to go for it now it's time to go for it and uh next up you know someone's head is going to be on the on the Block if if they don't do well towards the major right so yeah I mean this this major has so much so much pressure on it just because they missed Pais which everybody is saying and like I can definitely say that has been by far the biggest in terms of sticker sales so like that's a lot of money that's suddenly doesn't go to astralis you know and if that happens again like that is that is the the organization's uh um livelihood you know potentially up on the line because that is the kind of money that we're talking about sometimes and so yeah and next is the first CS2 major so I mean it's gonna pull a lot too probably in Copenhagen yeah and um uh yeah I mean yeah I'm as much as I can say of Paris definitely was an outlier in the big picture there was a lot you know it was a big one in terms of mon value when it comes to the stickers and all the income um compared to a lot of the previous ones but you can kind of expect and I would imagine I mean I'm just you know obviously I'm just speculating here but you'd think that they come up with something new for for the CS2 first you hope so right yeah I was kind of expecting that for the last C go major as well but I was disappointed enough to have they working on CS2 at the time you know you know they that's true that's true fair enough and they're still working hard on it now I hope so uh we need a couple more updates I think before we get the game to where we need it to be that's an interesting point yeah look it's not it's not far off the Mark I just think um you know a lot of the Grievances that that I I have and I think a large portion of the community is just the game comes out you don't have half the things that you had before of the game that we were playing for the last 10 years but you can't play the other it's like well okay that kind of sucks and I think some of that's been reflected in in um playing numbers at the moment but I don't think it'll last too long I think we'll have a turnaround at some point and all that hype will come back once we get into 2024 all right um let's jump into talking about well actually do you guys have anything else you want to talk about thisr stuff before I move on no no no I mean just like again like they missed out on Paris that's a big one yeah yeah fair enough okay let's let's quickly jump into uh talking about liquid so we've just seen them let go of all the players that we already knew they were going to let go of liquids like has been the most it's been the most it's been the the worst kept secret I think everybody knows what this roster is going to be and in the direction that we're they're going um it's just a matter of time and now that paty OC daps and Rain Waker have all been kind of dispelled of we've seen all those announcements come out over the last like week in a bit uh we know where this is headed right it's going to be KD and twist skulls Naf and um yakinda I don't know how I forgot about that and Zeus uh coaching right that's meant to be the the the this roster put together they're going to have enough in terms of the North American side of things um with twist Naf and skulls well America side of things so they'll be able to compete in the the America's uh ARR and all of that jazz so that's what the team is meant to be it's a pretty interesting roster when you put it all together on paper I think having two quite like emotional guys in the side of Kad and an yinda is going to be and and and twist as well I think is also in that sense yeah yeah so I think that's going to be like a nice it it could like if things are hunky dory as as as it goes if things are feeling quite nice um and everybody's loving the honeymoon I think those three will be great they'll be jazzing each other up I'm thinking about like ice hockey games they're going in they're bumping chest and stuff and everyone getting GED up like that that's what I can kind of see with the with these guys I can see a lot of that raw emotion coming into it and na will just still be chilling um and I don't know how skulls is going to find actually Zeus as well from the coaching chair there's going to be a lot of  fire in the belly with this team mate I'm okay well I've just got more excited reunions left and right man yeah Zeus back to to liquid this could be funid back to liquid we know with the last liquid moves that they were set up not to be temporary but they could easily just be temporary in the sense of well you know we we took a punt on rain wake it didn't really work you know we got paty that probably you know I don't know how much money that would have cost but maybe not too much crazy like we can we can get rid of these things these these aren't the we don't we're not tying our horse to this and and having a to to sail down Mary Lane but uh I think that this new roster is very exciting they've really taken advantage of of of where the markets I think the one that is baffling to most people is twists leaving phase especially with that interview that he gave it feels like a lifetime ago now but um what do we do we have any any answers on the twist phase liquid situation does anybody want to speculate on why they think he would be leaving I feel like Striker knows everything so he can't say and uh I think I as well a lot um so don't know I think it's going to come out come out when it comes out you know how these things come out when it comes out but I I think a big thing is is the whole like uncertainty around phase I think that was the biggest uh at least like right now over 50 I mean you know that just like everything that happened they got acquired because they're like in shitty economic situation and then after they got acquired it's not the end of the problems now they need to figure out the complexity face they right so there's just what is the future of this team are people going to be you know picked apart no one knows so I think that's what that was like the biggest part of nudging him into a new challenge and then I think there was there's also part of twists just wanting to do something different you know in in a different constellation where he is he's not like the the third fourth most important player on the team you know in in a way fourth because aragan is more important than him and then robs and and broi are the star players right so I think that's I think those two factors were I I think you also have to consider the timing because like people are now like why doesn't he just change his mind you know why doesn't he just stay with FaZe like now that they've been successful he didn't make he cannot make the decision anymore like do you if you even look back through rumors and stuff like that when they started this was during Sydney that it was already like okay twist is joining liquid like that was was pretty much set at that point you know like even from the communication from like d the US reporting and stuff like that before they won the first tournament in CS2 that he was already set on the Move pretty much so like that's that is the biggest thing that people need to consider you know and not like blame him for leaving now that they're winning everything it's like he canot he cannot change it if he's already committed you know I mean obviously it didn't mean much for Nico but I would say it's two different situations in terms of you know twist going back to liquid and then being like uh yeah you guys I'm I'm staying when it's also a team that he has a very good relationship with that he wouldn't want to you know kind of  over I feel like so yeah I think I think that's what makes it a different situation as well yeah I think I think it's exciting team sorry na no I was just gonna say it would be crazy if this face team like outside of if assuming that twist is going to leave uh it's not going to be sticking together after the acquisition goes through of course there's going to be like it have to be something's going to have to happen because they just simply cannot compete under the same ownership uh but you know there's an opportunity for someone there to jump in that would be insane though the value of the the value of those players though natu could you imagine having to buy four of them from FaZe like that's they're full household Counterstrike that would be crazy money uh yeah but at the same time what's like as assets for this this uh what's it called game Square um uh you know they're expensive uh assets also you know they they have running cost too right uh so just keeping the players on the bench would also kind of be silly right so but it's also like how much I mean oh someone might get a fire sale I was just gonna say like I don't think I don't think there are many Friday special I don't think there are many organizations that would be able to buy out an entire phase roster because like that's that's in the higher Millions for sure like if especially if you're buying an entire team whether or not they're forced into it and stuff like that that would be an expensive  team they're free the salaries are going to be just match their salaries as well I mean it's a massive  investment you know and it is like they are competitive at the moment you know like FaZe would still be able to get um like to to leverage a lot of money even if if they're forced into the situation you know and it's like um it really feels like it's got to be the complexity side that uh that gives in you know and that's that is like that organization is sold off and even like Jason Lake kind of implied that this could be a possibility you know like saying something like I could see complexity back in the red and black type thing you know because like that's that's their historic logo historic colors right so I feel like there's there's like indication that it might just be complexity like looking for for new investors coming and I don't have this like confirmed or anything like that but it seems like from from all the all the kind of standpoints like the team uh being much cheaper or like even the organization probably having much less power behind it you know if you're going to uh to get new investors to take it over you know all that stuff I feel like makes a lot more sense than have it B face which you know CS them alone is crazy would be crazy crazy crazy expensive yeah yeah for sure but when you buying phas you're kind of buying the brand right and you're they're putting like the OG guys who created the brand right yeah um but I mean it's got to be fun to see like how it opens out but yeah yeah I mean it's also that FaZe is like I was talking about this before you know FaZe is also like one of the most viewed teams basically of all time like they constantly pull in the biggest numbers and that's not just because of the teams that they've been having you know they did this even when they didn't have the greatest teams you know just because of the names that they had in the team you know and like they also like their stickers capsules have historically as far as I could tell been the biggest ones also through them being part of that sticker sticker capsule you know because they are like shared between those eight teams that are in that capsule but FaZe always like pulls up those numbers you know for that to be the biggest one you know so even from from the returns perspective you get some money back from from like more more stickers being sold all that stuff you know compared to that complexity doesn't really have any sort of power you know they are they are a big organization fairly big organization in North America but it's not like that market is currently being uh um like doesn't have a high value doesn't have a lot of a lot of power at the moment yeah yeah I the F yeah yeah yeah there's lots of things that we could say here isn't there but nothing we know that's really going to unfold other than Frozen joining phase so you know we can say that uh we'll see how many people want to you know that that I'm pretty sure that's happening so let's wait and see um I don't know who ma are going to get that's the next one that's probably going to come into the conversation who ma are going to be replacing Frozen with um so we'll have to we'll have to keep our eyes peeled on that we'll see if they want to promote somebody else from their Academy team they seem to be fantastic at doing exactly that um so we'll just quickly jump into the rumor mill I saw there was I don't I don't know if this is valid I just saw a tweet about it but Shiro to uh spirit at the start of next year I don't know if there's any truth to that at all but that would be interesting to see Shiro and Don together uh so I don't know where Shiro's going or what he's doing but I thought that was a fun one and then the other one is obviously about the reports to do with the roster coming together what's the core looking like at the moment OC daps um bre and like the other two would have been like seems like it's going to get rounded out with uh Fang and hex I think those are the two names there's like automatic also flying like on but there was something from D us that implied like he declined the offer which would be crazy to me considering where automatic has been for the past two years kind of buried in a in an EEG roster that never really went anywhere so I'm curious if that's actually going to come together or not but uh I think it's it's probably coming pretty close it ju it's it's it's hard to get excited but they're doing the best with what they've got I guess like what where else are you going who else are you diving into to try and pick up like not like EG really any of their players really showed anything crazy that's worth grabbing I don't know like yeah the at least I'm glad that an or like  is getting back into Counter-Strike but I don't know what they're hoping their return to be um because you even just to try and grow talent in that region is going to be difficult for a while unless we do have a big pop off with CS2 and then things start um yeah I don't know it's just it's not underwhelm well I guess it is underwhelming but there's only so many top tier Counter-Strike players what are you meant to do someone has to not be the best and not everybody can have the best team so I guess it just is it is what it is anyone have any anything they want to say about the rumor yes Prof yes you laugh about heroic in chat heroic are you here to talk about aralas there's also in chat he's not doing anything except heard that I that I leaked the number that they sold the two guys for and they're like what what is he talking about the Shir the spirit one I think that could be sexy I I don't see why it wouldn't happen seems Seems realistic to me uh unlike some other stuff that people have been reporting like I mean the the thing that you said about even the the ftic Swedish roster like that was never a reality that was never an option even even with a thing that came out now with Kumi being like Oh fanatic CEO said they inquired about broland yes they did but they didn't want a Swedish roster that was not enough that was they never wanted it no one ever wanted a Swedish roster on ftic so other people wanted it atic so just because they acquired for broland doesn't mean they wanted campus and knock and you know isach and whatever that that wasn't unfortunately the reality we live in why ruin that for everybody why ruin this that that's that's a fun reality I'm gonna be a party pooper a bit you know someone has to be fair enough um okay well we've been going for I guess just over two hours now do we want to just wrap up these events that happened and then be done with it yeah we can do it quickly yeah yeah let's just do a quick little round up right here uh we don't want to keep uh anybody for too much longer natu thank you for joining us and give us your time this evening it's been fun let's uh let's get through these last bits and Bobs now gentlemen over the course of the weekend we had blast fall finals in Copenhagen the Royal Arena and we had es so Challenger going on in yosha ping Sweden um now one event was a whole lot more exciting than the other um and that would be the blast fall finals of course uh we had what do you mean getting his first MVP isn't a big big happening to you they went under defeated they beat VP they would have really enjoyed beating VP in that semifinal I can imagine just like how  fired up they would have been doing that um but yeah I wanted to I wanted to just dial in a little bit about some of the uh headlines so's not winning there you go there's a headline phas not winning uh they they the Grand Final you know what's crazy about that honestly like imagine this is the last tournament with with twists and they win that tournament and they literally become undefeated in CS2 and twist seves after that that would have been cool like imagine having that Legacy you just leave the team undefeated and you're like you leave everything for for like interpretation and know what could have been and all that stuff but streak is broken yeah it then the final was pretty boring it was over pretty quick right like the vertigo was what was nuk was fun and there was a lot of twist and turns in that one I think the comeback was pretty cool the Eco win at the end not a lot of twists on the first map though yeah Jesus yeah had such a rough time it was 113 Mesi was like 010 at some point or something yeah what we I wasn't I didn't watch it live what was it what was the live viewing experience you were their Striker right you were you on the ground what was it like I I didn't get to see any of it live I was asleep I mean in terms of like Vibe and the arena I have to say I was pretty disappointed for it to be for it being a pretty big final I mean faas and vitality like those are two massive teams you have like obviously FaZe the most dominant team and then you have vital was I one the other side I was kind of surprised that the arena looked more empty than on like the first semi for example you know that from that perspective I was a little bit disappointed it's not like it was terrible or like bad but it's just like it didn't feel like a final you know it also contributed that you know just the first map wasn't great it was like pretty over pretty quickly um it was still kind of cool to see Flames just destroy everything on on on vertigo like he it could have been even so much more because like he was so close to to like winning a couple more clutches where he got like four kills but he just didn't get the last one you know all that stuff but I think he was I think he was pretty satisfied with himself because those two clutches were like two out of the three rounds that they lost so you know like from that perspective I think nuke was was really fun because like everything pointed to a third map and then raali start coming back then at the end it was also like again phas take momentum and they they lose the Eco you know that turn his back in vitality's favor you know so nuke as a map like I I found it really fun to to watch okay yeah and and overall the uh like I said I only only game I watched live was uh phase versus complexity and that's cuz I woke up early one day that was a good that was a series were getting away with some stupid there again like there like one v4s from rain from broi and there was like another one V2 from broi later like there was just like typical phe  you know like that how they win games out of nowhere you know like that game could have been another overtime between complexity and phase like easily like that's how Sydney went and that's easily how this could have gone to if it wasn't for some of these crazy moments man yeah the frustration for complexity you could see it creeping in again that's one of the things they have to try and reel in a bit from the same from the event perspective super funny going to the arena and then just saying that there's like the LCD billboard kind of outside and just seeing an ad for the pgl major um and the funny funny even funnier than that when the first day ended all of the screens inside became the same rotation from that billboard so you're like you are at the fall finals and like all of the screens inside over inside The Concourse right are just like pgl major pgl major PG major P which explains gone back huh yeah explains why they're going to a smaller venue next time and why this time it was not that great and like the last two years three years I don't know when I was there it was never fully fully like uh sold out like it's the classic sold out where they don't sell out don't sell onethird of the tickets like okay cool it's sold out I guess uh but obviously if there was more interest there would be more people there so it just seemed like it was uh it was too big and then with the major being there next year as well going back again it it's just kind of killing the killing the this taking away this what's the Thunder the storm something Prestige yeah but this happened this happened as well remember so we go back to uh what was it 2017 dreamhack L Vegas so that's what dream hacker pitched to be a major right but then they got it in Atlanta for e-league and then nobody went to the dream hack event in Vegas um because the major was already going to be in America and everybody just wanted to go to Atlanta so this is the same kind of thing we're talking what within the next four to five months this major is going to be going on in Copenhagen you're going to have all the best teams in the world there um it's going to be also absolutely absolute show with the heroic Australia situation to to kind of add on to what say teams man like for for blast it would be so much better to just allow the St St roster to go on and so Australis had a better chance to do something instead of playing with a dead roster you know but it was it was just  you know then you lose both of your good teams in the group stage amazing I mean that is kind of crazy you know that like first of all it happened at the time that it happened and you know like ases kind of forced this situation where neither team was able to use that full roster basically um so it's it's just rough you know like I do disagree with the rule being in place in general like just to block you know transfers up to 3 weeks before before a tournament or whatever it is with blast I think it's three weeks um because just it does it does prevent situations like realistically like this you know where like we could have had less dead teams playing in the event which I think is good for everybody like you'd rather have um fewer dead teams playing you know of course like the players that miss out on that tournament like for them it's the worst um but for everybody else for the viewers for the tournaments you know for the teams themselves it's obviously going to be beneficial if they don't have these limits you know in place uh and there are ways you can get around the issues that it causes you know that you change players like close to a tournament happening you know like in terms of organizing travel and all that stuff like that comes with it you know but obviously if you do have that rule in place like it's good that you follow it and blast it so that's that's all that I'm for the end of 2023 is us being haunted by csgo's past right that's that's what this is we got like a bunch of zombie teams just walking around half alive just like going from point A to point B just like it's it's it's just ghosts remnants of these teams with all these changes going on as everybody is trying to load both barrels as we move into 2024 and CS2 really kicks off because this is a teething phase for not only new rosters but the new game having it updated all the changes and then we're going to go through another big change next year as we shift from partner leagues into no partner leagues for 2025 so we do have uh Winds of Change in the air as far as Counter-Strike is concerned so it's no surprise to me that we're having these um little not hiccups but speed bumps along the way now it kind of makes a lot of sense it just it it does just detract from the excitement of the professional scenes actual importance of matches the only thing that matters is who won the event and who played good in the event in that event right because other than that we're not building a story right even with the cool thing with the phase one that you gave Striker was yeah okay they would have won them all and then done okay cool that's that's fun you know we leave that as like a a what if like you said but a lot of the other stuff is okay well this team won all right half the teams were dead well they're going to change roster or whatever so it does kind of take a little bit of the Shine off in that regard um but we're we're not far away now we're already late in November um okay n what did you think of it were you watching all the blast were you stand up all weekend watching all the games uh I I watched some of it not all of it uh you know I'm a family man I can't just sit watching you know Conor strike all day long unfortunately so I would love to and also I have work to do uh but yeah I thought it was a lot of fun especially like the uh like the face lexity uh matchup seems to just deliver time and time again even though like even ancient like even though the score line doesn't suggest that was just like an amazing game but with all those you know one fours and crazy things happening it was just yeah a lot of fun to watch and also uh was it na'vi complexity um the match which was navis should have been navis like nine out of 10 times they would have won that game uh it was a bit of a nightmare to watch that um from a na'vi perspective but yeah obviously if you're a complexity fan you're you're you're you're happy that it went that way but it was a weird one because like there were so many situations that like how did they just lose this round like it's a five on two where players are playing so scared on the bomb side they're not you know they're they're scared of taking any initiative where if they would have just both been aggressive they would have won that round already right so like um yeah weird things and I guess kind of teething issues uh for for them IM desk took a beating what's after that imma desk took a beating after they lost that that clutch the one to Hower I think it was from ramp yeah yeah what you GNA say Str yeah I was just going to say that there was kind of there was a kind of a cool story that maybe wasn't talked about enough when that was like electronic and alash like the rifl of old just turning up in really great form like both of them were like would have been MVP candidates if they went into the final you know and and that's I mean that's great to see because I think a lot of people have given up on a Le and being like the superstar that he used to be right and uh and now with with complexity he's having this second wind like he missed out on the last top 20 you know I don't know if he's actually he would be actually in the running for this one you know but like it's kind of cool that that we see him like still have these Peaks and the same goes for electronic because again like a lot of people are giving up on giving up on him being an igl and being able to put up those same numbers and now he is boage back and somehow it just works for him you know he was putting up every like pretty much the same iname lead who would have thought I mean exactly right but also it was like it was happening before with Hobbit as well and like he wasn't still there yet completely but like this event has he has kind of turned it around obviously you know it's still just one tournament but it was just cool to see that uh that he was back in his old ways you know and that's also the reason why complexity CL 9 were so competitive and we can stay on the Cloud9 topic for a moment they with the placing they got they got enough points to qualify for the World Finals uh so Cloud9 I believe the last team locked in for the World Finals which is going on in like 17 days from now or whatever you got FaZe Vitality m n G2 Nai Cloud9 and heroic the only team that I would say is probably missing the only team that I would take out of this and I would bring one in I'd get rid of heroic obviously because they're not even a real team uh and I would put in complexity um just based off this form towards the end of the year but that's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes um but that's the that's the World Finals we got coming up for blast in where is it is it Dubai Abu Dhabi later in the year yep uh we've got B Boom coming up which that one is one is in Dubai right yep uh and we've got the Alyssa Masters which is kicking off tomorrow so that's basically the end of the year as far as the tournaments are concerned um and we did touch on we did touch on the the Monty scenario over there in yosha ping um VP they just love going and trying to farm these Challenger events Don't They isn't this like vp's bread and butter just farming these Challenger going too don't they they too yeah yeah yeah you get like a spot in the pro league or like uh like at least something along those lines there's probably in Atlanta yeah I I guess there must have been in y shipping too I actually didn't I'm not actually sure about that I'm just you know throwing that out there probably their MO motive to go to these yeah there is there is a spot in Pro leag say season season 19 in y tripping and it is in Atlanta as well yeah yeah okay will that make sense yeah that makes and the thing is the caliber of the teams at the event it's not like they're all easy beats obviously because VP didn't win there like teams that you're going to have to actually work a little bit harder against I don't know if the same can be said for Atlanta who's in Atlanta let's have a look it's actually better even like because it's complexity there too okay complexity complexity Monty very VP then gamer Legion Apex Mongols M8 besta okay that's not bad that should be that so that will be the final event of note by the looks of things but for the end of the year right so that'll be going on at the same time as the blast World Finals all right all right well there's everybody time zone everyone happy yeah all right cool all right it's been a bit of a length of your episode I apologize for that I was trying to keep it you know down to the 2hour mark But I failed again um that probably will happen more and more as I as I try and you know get a hold of time as Jame masterfully does um natu thank you for joining us this evening it's been great to get your insights and uh have a chat with you we don't get to do this very often so thank you for joining us um is there anything that you'd like to say to the people at home or just in general uh thanks for having me it was a lot of fun uh always fun to be a part of part of uh a good show and um if you happen to be in Finland you know next weekend make sure to make your way to the uh Ela Masters because you know we we would like to fill Arenas here in Finland and and get bigger and bigger events happening here in the future and one way to do that is to actually have a lot of people come to these events so uh for sure finish Counter Strike fans everyone come on let's do it say oh yeah what yeah what are you expecting no I was I was asking if if you were if you're expecting the sort of turnout that was that last time because I think that came slightly as a surprise to me you know that that asool was such a good such a good event in terms of the turnout um I think uh yeah from from like I think last year's Saturday was almost like pretty much sold out yeah um it was a good very very good vibes I think it's going to be somewhere similar uh this year from what I've understood uh a Friday is a top one always uh in in in anywhere really considering the games are already starting at like what 400 p.m. or something so people are just only getting out of work or school um so to make it to the first game is always going to be tough and then can you justify yourself to come to the to the second game later and pay the full price whatever um but yeah Saturday should be good and hopefully Sunday as well so uh uh yeah last year was great in terms of atmosphere and everything so uh yeah a big thumbs up for from for me I was even I was surprised like how good the atmosphere was there it was it it was enjoyable to watch from home last time around I remember um I think the thing is with this and you make a good point like you can build these events but the people are going to come it's the same kind of thing as what Prof was just referencing with the Copenhagen event that we just had same thing with how I think kitzer is trending thing is the events can be put on you can offer everything in the world you can have the best teams there but if the people who are coming they're not engaged right the the event the event can be everything you need but if the people aren't the ones who are you know making the most of it and enjoying their time then and again they're the ticket they're paying for the tickets they can enjoy it however the they want but that's that's one way to make your you know your crowd memorable or make it so people want to come back or more people who are watching at home want to come to these events so hopefully another good turnout hopefully a good event I wish you the best of luck in Finland in this next week again thank you for joining us uh quick shout out to our sponsors once more 22 bet remember to gamble sponsor steel series and Trad it. um that's been Prof Prof give him a wave he's at a few technical issues are you still muted no I want to say uh to these two guys in chat that are spamming the same message all the time about how does the blast uh audience compared to the gamers8 audience is number one what kind of stupid question is that are we comparing a studio event to one of the standout L Arena events that we have what the hell also do I have to compare every event that ever happens to every other event that ever happens I feel like that's going to make quite long episodes and number three it's only relevant because it's a smaller audience than last time and we also didn't even have a Friday in the arena because it's relevant because it's connected to the major and it's connected to the shift of the of the arena for next year that's why it's relevant and I don't have to compare it to Brazil either thank you it's nice that a little bit of me is leaking into Prof right now I like that like a little bit of like what goes on in my brain is just leaking into Prof it's it's good fun Striker you've been in good spirits today do you want to have a little rant too or are you are you good saw the exact same thing I'm like I'm not even sure where this is coming from I mean obviously the gamers a crowd of so like is that what we have to say like it's obvious we need to make sure that we highlight these things every time we talk about something else I don't know I don't understand that's the way it goes anyway we're going to leave here before Prof punches his monitor we're going to get out of here thank you everybody for joining us this evening we'll be back next week we've got another guest we've got
