wow it's hard to say Spirit are in the best form isn't it because they they did disappoint in in their matchup um they they felt like they they got blown out they blown back but by Ma in in b d that

what's happening today uh gentlemen there hasn't been a whole lot of uh talk right we were speaking last episode that y Compass is just around the corner that event come to its conclusion people are getting upset about definitions of events um and so so how how would you define yellow compus Striker well we have a very clear definition that it in that it's not a big event so that's where the discussion ends to me what's what's this s tier thing I've never heard that before wow we're going to start a feud Prof between hltv and liquid pedia could we settle this with like an arm wrestling match or should it be like a fight to the death you guys have to put like nominate someone the boxing boxing would be the thing celebrity boxing yeah okay but it's like a a three three not three rounder you know a card with three fights I think that would be that would be the way too who would they even be able to put up over there at liquipedia problem is like half of them also work for us yeah a lot of people our chat as well so we're gonna have some problems then look uh the as the chat the chat is reacting to your appearance once again I thought they were reacting to me like wobbling back and forth I've got my mechanical massager with me because I my my shoulder blad's a bit sore today so I'm try looks very dystopian I have to say it's it's kind of good um but yeah good I said I was going to do a factory research this summer so I've done a factory resear I shaved my face and I shaved well I didn't completely shave my face and I shaved my head um but I I didn't I didn't want to have the problem that came before when I had to get my hair transplanted I was super down on emo for the better part of like two years CU I was like [ __ ] I hate this so I was like if I shave my head I know it seems crazy counterintuitive why would he get a hair transplant if he's going to shave his head again but I did it so that I remember that it doesn't really matter what my [ __ ] top of my head looks like it's all good you know still look the same so it's it's all part of the ab do not do not look the same yeah I I just well I was telling you guys this before when I was at the gym this morning the blow that normally I see did he couldn't even recognize me he had to pull up the photo and everything like that so uh yeah just it's for the mental I don't know if it it's made the mental any better or worse but that's why I did it so um and get it'll grow back so it's all good it's not not a problem yeah yeah okay cool everyone happy everyone in chat assciated with that answer we want updates on the mental state yeah all right cool uh all right let's get into the show Lucas are you ready to run the bumper let's [Music] go all right we're back in business and we're going to get into the news now uh there's been some more into the breach signings uh just the other day SM was announced as the first piece they obviously trying to rebuild the team I I was under the impression they wanted to go more nationality based um they announced synops today obviously of of Guild bad news Eagles Fame uh as the in-game leader so I'm curious to see where this goes I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more players from Bad News Eagles Gill get signed to that signed to that team like rigon and and uh Jan flro would be the two that I would probably be looking to to get as rifl in that roster uh but I don't know do you know anything Striker have you heard anything on the gra Vine what's going on and why are they doing it player at a time why can't they just announce the whole team yeah that's always annoying right but more clicks that's probably why anyway I I mean it seems like it would be more I don't actually know the the full lineup I just know that they had multiple things in mind like one of them I think which I didn't understand is like why is everybody so um obsessed with Danish rosters like I I heard that there was like a possibility of them getting a Danish roster so that would have been a bit weird I I'm kind of better I'm more glad that they're going this way at least there's one Brit in there Jo I think there's a little bit more Legacy at least yeah well I I I don't really um when Smo tweeted out the other day he tweeted out bunch of British flags and a Polish flag didn't he but I guess he was just trolling yeah I guess he was trolling he did tweet this like in the last week sometime which is great I don't know I don't know why he's gone for that but yeah sure he has I don't know what to expect with this team it's interesting to see smoa back on a roster and one that's being built from from scratch I guess that was uh the the way he thought would be best to get back underway and into the bridge giving him an opportunity to play Within this team do you think we get Thomas back in there Prof oh I guess we don't need him now we've got we got sopsy that I mean sopsy is Elling right uh I think just a combination of the of the ex ex Eagles guys and smoa that's going to be a firecracker of a team like so we be missing and gxx right yeah that's that's most likely I mean those were the weakest individual performers right from the from the lineup gxx to some degree he was sometimes pretty good but he was also the oper so obviously smya would would take that spot right um so I don't know in my opinion seems Seems like a fun lineup uh seems like an interesting team obviously it's not going to be easy to get to lands um they need to you know grind online qualifiers are kind of coming out of nowhere and everything like that but I feel like on land they would be a fun team to watch so hopefully hopefully get to see some of it in people saying Thomas is on 5w who the [ __ ] is five W red Joel Prime Taps and Thomas who the what the [ __ ] is that I literally read that as Thomas is the fifth but F wheel like he's the fifth player on the team but like uh that was definitely not what was said at all this is this was uh this team came together like a month ago I want to say something like that uh it's been going on for a while I would I wanted to ask a question about rigon right he's Swiss right yep yeah here we go here we go could he not play for big uh I don't know if he speaks that mean in Switzerland they have multiple well Maniac speaks all the languages mate he speaks the German and and the French speak German yeah he stood in for German teams before like he played it he played it like the national champs for then he's won one Maniac like years ago like five years ago or something like that yeah but I don't know if he speaks what language mean doesn't rigon doesn't sound like he speaks French but maybe it's just not his first it wasn't his first language and I don't know how exactly it Works in Switzerland I would I would imagine him more speaking German so maybe you're right there stereotyping like all Balan people going to German to work you know um but he is like part Albanian isn't he no yeah for sure yeah yeah that's why he was part of Guild Eagles right yeah yeah he's only 24 as well so he's still still a young enough man yeah I don't know I I I would assume that him and flro at least flro goes with synops I think flro is a pretty Punchy rifler as well so we'll have to wait and see what more comes out of the into the breach camp but I don't think there's too much more to say about that for now uh jumping into some more recent news nbk and NAA are back with what is it Revenant yep what does Revenant mean should I look it up isn't that like Aur creature or something I don't know what the Reverend yeah Revenant Revenant someone who has yeah I think you're right Lucas someone who's returned especially someone who's returning to life after being dead that's yeah he did go to valerant right so that makes sense too man that's crazy Longs as well uh he's part of that roster addex um I don't know if I'm saying that right and also also a kid from Romania who was the fifth Reiko okay and he's a Polish lad that name I'd seen before I I but I don't really remember where I feel like on a bunch of these like third fourth best polish teams over over the years it was like on Ono he was also on one of these Academy rers that I forgot which one oh he was in sprout at the end I think he was playing with Taz for a while in Neo I think in the roster yeah that's where I remember him from the the most but it's uh not a not a bad lineup I think long can be a good rifler obviously he's still quite young and and whatnot um I feel like a lot of obviously like it depends on where we where we kind of [Music] wna where do we expect them to be and what the expectations they have from themselves obviously I think the names have pretty decent potential right nbk I presume lling as he's he's been kind of leaning into for the last couple of years uh Nea is a very exciting name um I don't know how much we can expect from him in in CS or anything right now but overall seems like a pretty pretty decent mix of players right that that there's there's something to it and they instantly got invited to because the org is from India right and they got invited to the Sky Sports Masters um obviously some uh uh some of their events didn't really happen as they as they wanted to but let's say in the quiz it's a it's a good um it's a good starting point for for this team a good chance to prove themselves I think any rosters that are coming together now have a decent Runway into the next major even though there's no open qualifiers right they just need to have um some success in some of these open qualifiers for other events to try and get themselves some ranking points so if you're starting now that feels integral right if you're if you're from Europe and you're not starting now you're going to have a tough time because I mean it's probably going to be tough anyway just because like if you have a completely new team that has no uh previous scoree or you have to start from from zero completely then I mean yeah you just have to Boom straight out of the gate because otherwise you don't you don't get into a big event you don't get no you get no points even if you get to into some of these ccts like unless you do really well from the start you're not going to get the ranking and you need to get into one of those CL qualifier so that's that part yeah I'm curious about if that's going to be possible for this team because it's going to be hard for anybody new but what you were talking about with like I mean in the same lines with uh with into the breach I mean if they keep a trio from from Guild Eagles then you know at least they have a starting point that's not the complete restart Maniac was just in chat and he says for record Ron definitely speaks German and I've been losing my mind for years that big didn't pick him up okay um so that's just confirmation on the regon German Germany speaking I think we're going to talk a bit more about big later right so we should be able to well we can maybe seg with that into the look that's the thing he is probably going to this roster but I really am basing that off nothing so I don't know I'm just if I was into the breach I'd probably take a punt on on the solid members of this team try and bring in a good ala try and bring in another Plucky rifler and see where you go that that's what I'd be doing but who knows what they're do yeah yeah I did hear that that's like a core of the b& guys were sticking together just a couple of them were separating but okay I that's also a while ago I'm not 100% sure that that's actually what's happening under this a breach it's just my assumption just because it would make sense like you don't as I said you don't want to start from complete scratch yeah okay all right all right uh well Revenant we'll keep our eyes on these Lads see what they get up to you know it's I think the Nea angle that you mentioned is probably the most exciting part of this but I don't want to say this is underwhelming it's it's a little bit overhyped just because of like people know him from valerant and I mean okay that means something I suppose over there but NCS it's not like he was bad but we only saw him play on like three Maps he never really made it into the main roster in Vitality so we didn't get to see much most of it was on the online ER as well just because once we got to land there was no way you could have played in a six-man roster a lot at the time because of Val rules and stuff like that nobody wanted to stick with it so I'm just like of course it's a name that we had on our minds when he was part of Vitality but I mean since then it's been what almost three years that we haven't seen him in CS so um it's it's probably going to be a Slow Burn oh okay yeah all right this one here it's like not blowing me out of the water but it's interesting to see this mix of players together uh and MBK and long were together on falcons as well right yes yeah so there's a little crossover there all right uh keep it moving this is going to make Prof really excited because I know he's a massive fan of the OG organization Fu getting an extension over there Prof I bet when you saw tell me when saw when you saw this were you not surprised surprised in what regard like I was surprised that they are like extending with anyone mate nothing that OG does surpris for like I I just didn't didn't think they I didn't think this team was going anywhere I thought this was like they're just going to wither away uh what do you mean aren't they selling heavy gold for like half a million dollars or something that's what people are saying on the interwebs so using that to extend Fu well if you keep Fu there and he's gonna stay at the same level and never get better then what you can do is you can always bring in better players around him to make them look good and then sell them I mean that's that's the business idea that's sounds pretty sounds pretty good actually because yeah just um don't hate him seems like seems like a nice guy plays Counter Strike nothing like doesn't really blow you out of the you know blow your mind but doesn't really suck too much either he's okay he's an okay guy I just I'm just surprised that this team is still around just there I want to know why they're still investing honestly this heavy guard signing that they got is just it's crazy like he was pretty like everyone was talking about him before OG so just the fact that they managed to get him at this time and then just I don't want to say keep him hostage but like it was like a short-term investment like a punt on a stock or something it's like we're just waiting until someone is gonna pay enough because obviously we're not gonna we're not going to accomplish anything with him on the roster is going to play good but we're still going to not do anything and then it's just like waiting until the good enough offer comes in and that's yeah but we get to see them play blast groups again Prof that's great only for one only one more time only one more time season one more season come on we're and then a showdown as well it's crazy actually completely unrelated but like all of these qualifiers are happening right now for like Showdown already for like four months away it's like three four months away from now it's like what the hell is going on what kind of doesn't make any sense but okay I guess whatever this is a little bit off topic but I am also surprised about heavy got being there especially after learning after the fact that he does speak Russian so like you have so many opportunities to go anywhere else that actually has a future you know like we've seen the trajectory from ogi for a while and it's not like I have anything against any of those pieces like individually it's just altogether it's not very exciting they haven't done anything for I don't even know how long at this point they've been bad since Inception well I wouldn't say that I think at the beginning when they had like the OG OG like nbk Alexis team mantu was there who was the last one I'm missing one uh valda there you go flamy no valde was there at the beginning then flamy was a bit later I thought we were talking about good players when flamy and Dexter was there there was also like at least those two pieces there was something exciting there they had like a couple of good runs with Nexa like there was something they were at top 15 top 20 team for a while you know for two three years I would say but now they're like bottom of the barrel of all the teams that decided to go in International just because they haven't invested in any real talent it's all like kind of what do people think what I just said was a dig at valde I was mentioning play I was just saying I was just saying like Striker was listing good players who had been in the team I didn't realize we were doing the ones at Inception I thought we were just listing the good players that have been in the roster F the way you said it so you think Val is a good player not anymore I think he was he's still on TSM right that's also I'm pretty sure yes we haven't seen anything from him in quite a while yeah who's on the TSM roster now did they go Z you're your your mate your one of your favorite players D's cool of all time yeah well they don't have a roster at the moment weren't they meant to be signing a full Danish roster that seems to be what was happening yeah nothing nothing's happened what's going on so okay well [ __ ] pin the P pin the tail on the roster right now who knows what's going on um okay uh that's why I was saying like I'm not sure why everybody's obsessed with the building Danish rosters because I heard the same thing about like one more or that I don't even remember now that like five different ORS were looking into building Danish teams I'm like that's so 2020 you know yeah talking about heavy Gods this Cloud9 thing this is like percentage confirmed what would you say Striker what sorry one more time how much how how confirmed How likely is have you got to Cloud n considering that every like every one of the leakers like Russian leakers have said it that's usually a pretty good indication that it's true I don't actually know that 100% for myself though I just know like from what I knew before uh heavy God was one of the people that nip were looking into and it was looking I mean those that was rumored for a really long time yeah at some point but I think he was just too expensive for an IP to get for what he was going to bring like over Isaac who I think probably was either for free or something close to that close to that so uh that was the only thing that I heard about heavy God I haven't actually heard uh since then any updates on on if he was going anywhere I I saw people asking questions today there was uh people wanting to know you know oh hack come we haven't know anything from liquid yet the the events been over for a while like Dallas obviously and I think a lot of people need to keep in mind that with these roster changes a lot of the teams would wait until the break has started because at that point everybody's seasons are over and then there's probably conversations going on right right now and there's probably teams and players who are deep within those conversations who have maybe even signed in some instances um but we won't know about that until towards the tail end of the player break because they want to get their you know they want to get their news out there when it's going to actually get them some clicks I mean it's also stuff like the invites right so I think now the colog invites are out yes because like the the the cut off for the invites and the points everything we can take a look at that Lucas can you whack this link up yeah so so essentially you know if you make make a roster change or announce for example the benching of kadan you could lose a percentage of the points that could send you down the ranking um I think I think liquid even had this happen to them like last season when they made all of their changes and like left only two players on the roster that you know they didn't get by then uh so which kind of put them off on a on a kind of difficult cycle that they had this year in terms of like having to play all of the qualifiers um obviously the team didn't really gel together either so that didn't help but it would have been easier if they had to play like two three online qualifiers list than they than they did but yeah as you see liquid uh got an invite for the play and or now it's called stage one stage two as the official ESL is it I miss that if you go on the tweet it says like stage one and stage two so I don't know if there's because they want to make it look less like a qualifier than it is yeah I mean yeah well it's not going to change anything in the way you guys do the presenting of the event so it doesn't really matter does it like I don't know if we're going to rename it just because they they renamed it I think he me like the stats Parts but that's completely different yeah that's that's a different problem yeah yeah yeah but I just taking a look at this list let me read it out for everybody playing at home uh we can use the vernacular of either if you'd like so the stage one teams or previously the playin teams would be heroic Falcons NZ flyest Imperial big pain s Eternal fire complexity the Mongols liquid fury boom MBR and team for the German qualifier who's the best German team other than big right now because it used to be Sprout for a very long time but then they went all Danish right and that's been that that's felt the case for for is it attacks I would that's in my head but I don't even know if they have a German team anymore let's let's German German doesn't even show up in the rankings anymore because they teams there no it's got to be attack surely uh attacks where is attacks let's see big has an academy roster right they are number 80 on the I don't even know who else now has a has a German team that is that is notable that has been playing like at a decent level in these um Tier Two Three Tournament people people saying M80 they're not far away to be honest yeah I mean just make one more change play in this Open qualifier you can make it into colog actually true play with a stand in actually real true they could do that didn't someone say like floppy has German citizenship or something like this something somebody said that yeah did somebody say that well they can't do that cuz lob's playing for [ __ ] complexity come on now guys let's not get will he be playing for complexity after the break oh good question oh okay oh [ __ ] look at this we're really opening a few doors right now see the production quality there from Lucas with the alternate attacks uh logo popping up on the the thing I didn't see it it was insane look look wait wait wow look at that look at this he's he's on he's on point today uh anyway so those are the teams for the the play-ins or the stage one uh and the stage two or the main event is Spirit phase Vitality aalis Mal G2 na'vi VP and colog in just under two months from now right I think it's yeah once we get back from the break you've got the Esports World Cup you've got the blast fall groups and then it's into cologne so that's going to happen pretty quickly after we get out of the tournament break anybody that we're missing anything that you feel doesn't really make any sense gentlemen I think having another German team VI a qualifier I make sense it is a German event but the fact it's going to be attack that that kind of well it might not even be attack but you look at that and you go okay but do not do not remember the time that uh big got a local hero invite and they went to to the final of colog but big already there all right so what you telling me attacks are going to win the qualif and then go to theal at the time big people are also SM mate no that's one time I mean you said uh you guys all said that Stewie is not going to do anything with G2 and getting to that later all right we can't wait to hear what you guys have to say about Taz that's going to be my favorite part of the evening you guys are haters we're going to be labeled haters for the second time man it's I didn't read the comments of the YouTube video I've I've stopped now because it's giving me like aneurisms um but how were the comments no I didn't I didn't there was one comment that said you should not read the comments yeah nice and you should just say what you want to say that was that was a com yeah yeah that was directed to you that was directed to you directly to me no there's a comment for me uh that I was extremely quiet after Mon's performance compared to donk which factually incorrect because it was just the three of us so we were talking I was talking quite a bit I would say at least 30% of the time I was I was talking so I don't know if that if that could be qualified as being quiet but you I understand why part of parts of the conversation made it seem like that but we also gave plenty of credit to G2 for how they did it and why they did it and all that stuff we just tried to explain it away doesn't mean we didn't like them doing it or we hate them for for whatting it was just like just doesn't make sense man no this is what I'm telling you just have to give up and just go the full viewer experience give them everything they want all the time right and then they can because their opinions are the ones that are right so I will I will say one thing that it's not even about comments specifically but one thing that I have taken to heart is trying to say like less and I'm curious if anybody has noticed so far because I'm being very careful about what I say the thing is there going to notice when you do something they don't like they're not going to notice when you do something they do like it's the same with observing right like if you [ __ ] it up then everybody notices but if you do it right nobody notices because that's how it's supposed to be exactly yeah yeah uh all right here we go let's uh let's jump into the next well actually what we could do we could look at the teams who qualifi for pro league as well I suppose because uh yeah actually no the thing is that it's missing a couple it's not really a goodl looking team list right now no it's not red kids it's like half of the teams is well like I'm not really obviously I don't want to be a hater and be like one of those guys that here we go I used to hate ugly hater but you are a hater I don't want to be one of those guys like ah this is not a big name therefore I don't care you know but if if there's like 10 of these names uh I doubt most of them will do anything like I I I like having Underdog here and there you know we need to give opportunity but like the team list doesn't look doesn't look very exciting right now what do you mean pro league is esl's Flagship event Pro what are you talking about ESL Hater eppl Hater right here there go well that's that's what's going to happen when you have 32 teams playing at event that's going to be a diluted field especially with when you're giving two spots to Australia like you're giving two spots to Oz what's going on there and the are the Mongols even qualified hopefully they get in through ranking they should get through ranking yeah there's three there's like three more spots through ranking so that that should happen yeah it's kind of funny that there's a talk is in there but uh the no Mongols flying uh could also win ching and qualify through that by the way because that's also another spot yeah that would be cool to see win that honestly possible because what's who's their biggest competition their complexity right yeah yeah yeah yeah that event is not is not very stacked at all all right let's uh let's keep flying through the recent news uh the next little bit is about vorg retiring from the coaching position people might remember him from the C Flames days then he spent some time at EG um which which nobody will remember him for which you don't want to be remembered for uh but he he's hung up the what what would Co pry pry the Tactical timeout sign he's logged out of Sky Edge what the notebook yeah the notebook yeah but okay but uh I think it's pretty tough for coaches isn't it to find a team at least one that because I don't know how these smaller ORS work um but I imagine coaches are probably not very highly paid position and in terms of organizations that can afford or or or even have coaches you're you're not dealing with a huge amount of them I I wouldn't say um and obviously feel like it's the it's the like sticker money if you have that kind of a deal in the team is where you can get the most as a coach and obviously if you're the zics of the world or whatever that get like serious but I I think outside of the top 10 15 already I think the coaches are really devalued in terms of payment for sure yeah and uh he's he's mentioned he put out a long statement I don't know if anybody gave it a read uh but he mentioned that he wanted to try and get to the business side of things so could be doing more uh managerial type stuff on the backend type stuff uh but this piece of news what he said what sadly both projects are comp to fairly quickly changing nature as both R to unen economic situations it's what can happen I don't believe anyone for it but just St being Mass potential in both EG and pry at the time of joining yeah look I I think at the moment as well I look I'm I'm definitely not anybody who reads the news I just occasionally will get little bits coming across my my feeds um but right now things are things are pretty [ __ ] in the world right things are really expensive things are where we're some places in recession I don't even know if I'm using that terminology correctly as a 34 year old man all I know is that the times are tough there's inflation going on as well there's inflation there's some recession there's of there's there's some crisis different types of them but we always bounce back don't we you know things are temporary we'll have a couple years where things are kind of shitty and then we'll have some years where things are kind of good and then we'll have some more years where things are kind of shitty and that's just kind of the way the cookie crumbles I mean just to see like two cents on him definitely a guy that showed that he can add value in some of these like smaller teams um with very limited budgets that that managed to do something even freezy I think was okay considering you know what they were uh obviously is notable for the Copenhagen Flames which is like a super small orc uh in terms of like money and and budgets so some pry going under don't they still exist though I mean they made a new team or something so I don't know what the [ __ ] is going on there so it was just Financial they couldn't afford the team that they signed pretty much I mean they had debris for a while so who knows what that meant yeah okay all right well are we anyone else want to say anything about VOR not or anything he's probably going to find a a spot for himself I feel like keep kicking along I mean he said he also he said something in the in the statement that he found something outside of Esports or he like got an opportunity somewhere uh somewhere outside of Esports that will allow him to focus more in his family so it seems like he did that's the reason why he announced his retirement rather than you know announcing his retirement and then looking into whatever else he can do sure all right uh last pie of the news this is the recent variety where did this come from Furious show interestes in Phelps who who reported this where did Brazilian Outlet um that reported this curious piece of uh piece of rumor honestly why curious well because we've seen it before right Paul being interested in teaming up with his old teammates okay well would not the first time that would happen yeah yeah I see what you're saying okay well the thing is Phelps has to me in more recent time has actually started showing again a little bit of decent form but for the longest period of time he was very underwhelming like he just felt like he was was very Miss there was no hit he was just miss and he was once upon a time a very aggressive rifler alongside of fur when they were both in the same team together at the same time it was catastrophic but if they were looking for someone to try and fill that void I don't think Phelps is Young anymore is he 27 27 okay so he's okay well he's he's not he's not done yet and who knows how far these guys can go these days it's just a bit underwhelming just because of you'd hope that they would be able to get one of these younger guys you know who have been coming up the scene in Brazil rather than recycling the older Talent well if you going to take someone from Imperial wouldn't you go for one of the newer Lads like uh decent or no way yeah obviously rolls but yeah I don't know how it how it works rwise necessarily because like who knows if that's also the end of the changes right but assuming it's just one change uh then I'm also not sure that Phelps would be a one to one because I mean euro is already particularly pretty aggressive on that side and maybe there will be some clashes there with Phelps um who knows how it would work otherwise right um but it's just bit unfortunate that with Brazilian see how it's looking at the moment that the these big transfers very rarely happen because they are locked behind crazy contracts and they just like we saw how much skulls was worth you know when it was going to liquid was like 400,000 or something 600 even 600,000 right and that's a little bit insane you know for players that haven't necessarily proven their worth on the international scene in some ways I would I'd rather have Phelps than skulls to be honest on this team I think I think it makes more sense to have like a more aggressive player than more than a more passive player um obviously yeah Yuri and ker are pretty passive right yeah y know Yuri's not Yuri's Yuri's been in pretty aggressive position but but not as necessarily the first guy in yeah that's why I think like Phelps could could work um inani or whatever some of these names would be would be nice but ah nothing doesn't really you know get your dick card as people would say as GB James yeah one one person yeah okay yep well they also have to get a coach too don't they because weren't they meant to be replacing Gary with that role I forgot that they announced that well that is what they said right when they had when they got rid of art but Gary's still there and coaching then then they did like what what they call it like the meeting of the Tactical regiment or something Tactical it was some madeup term where it's like yeah it's I know what you mean though yeah it was Fallen Gary and someone else from the like management yeah was like okay Gary so what do you think should Gary be replaced and he's like Ah that's a good idea guys but maybe you should just give him a bit more time I think he's been pretty loyal to the team and then and then they decided to maybe not replace him after all what if they I know you said that they should go for someone more aggressive as opposed to play that skulls but what if they just took skulls and Zeus from liquid and they gave liquid caser actually liquid don't need any more passive players either do they uh you know okay I mean yeah I mean that would depend on how they want to restructure the whole thing but ques has had plenty of options I think at this point we'll just give up on quesado like we have with tson uh all right let's keep let's keep going shall we let's keep let's keep plotting along uh let's make our way how much of the yellow Compass did you guys watch the best of ones I know Striker was invested he had to be I was unfortunately more invested in the results rather than actually watching the games because that's all I could pay attention to at the same time was like so much [ __ ] work that the best on actually wasn't so much of what I actually watched I can tell you I did not watch much of the AL compas so I'm I'll I'll be ask I'll be inquiring about your guys's uh okay your guys' opinions as much as possible because I I just follow the results but not actually like in depth watch the game so I don't think I can add that much qual to to the to the discussion right there I definitely wasn't watching uh a truckload of the best of ones like I'd whack a couple on but I wasn't like fully invested into them when only when it was like an interesting matchup I wasn't going to spend the entire time watching all of the games when I like to be honest this type of event I think it's a good event to to have right of of this scale and it had some more notable names in it um and this is where events are more important to different teams who are in attendance but for everybody at this event you can make make an argument of why this would be important for them right if FaZe was at this event it'd be like uh you know okay well they should win because FaZe is the team here but other than that being the angle right they might not be motivated because the field or the prize actually the prize most of these I was going to say most of these teams that were invited actually all of them had a lot of motivation to play there maybe or kind of high goals because maybe the only team that you could make an argument for not having Mega High goals for it would have been ANS just because it was their first event with with poy so it's more like a testing ground than anything else but everybody else had like stuff stuff to prove if you look at I mean the entire group a otherwise Mongols nip asres asres are still looking for their first win with the new team I'm sure they were very interested in winning this definitely um then you have heroic who are just back with Dexter for them it was for them in a complexity maybe it was a little bit weird just because they came straight off of Dallas yeah um complexity went into the tournament like 10 hours before their first game or something like that they they arrived to the to the hotel um but other than that I mean everybody had plenty of motivation to do well even ftic who just came in with blamef I'm sure like after that big signing you're kind of looking to to get a decent result in and I would suppose that they did same as big I would like you could make an argument that it's important for every event that bigs in is important for them b b the same this is still a team that's searching for its identity and victories uh Eternal fire a chance to try and like legitimize themsel more within the upper echelons of Counter Strike and they came second last Within in their group so yeah that was a very disappointing finish well let's let's jump in with the with the meat and potatoes which is the Mongols winning back-to-back events they won uh the event in their home country against European opponents they' be bleed in the final just uh a week before this one and then they've gone into this one as one of the I guess more favored names for me it would have been the likes of Mongols Australis complexity Eternal fire heroic like that type of a mix before I saw any of the games going down or but those would be the names that I would have been expecting to make deeper runs and probably play some quality Counter Strike um but that obviously didn't tend to be the case but for Mongols they did lift the trophy 910 getting an MVP at the event that's pretty sick and I think for the development of this team it's huge right I think winning in Mongolia is is is great especially over European opponents but then being able to do it at an event and I know it's not a European event but it's still considered an international event with mainly European teams in attendance that is a big step for them and as far as Asian Counter-Strike goes I think this is some of the best counter- strike actually probably the best counter- strike that we have seen a team from the region play uh because they're actually playing Team CS they're not playing gimmicky Counter-Strike I love the moves that they make right they actually understand the jigsaw puzzle okay we've lost this space we need to push in an agro here the the individuals are very sharp I think that's something we've been touting for a very long time binho is starting to look more beded with into the team because I remember earlier on in the year he looked out of his depths but he's also only a 16-year-old kid which needs to be kept in mind like I'm not sure it's really difficult to put yourself in the shoes of a 16-year-old kid when you're you know like a 34 year old man like me now it's it's I'm very detached from [ __ ] what does it feel to be 16 again I know what it's like to play Early competition and to be nervous and everything like that but to be 16 you know You' you got the [ __ ] hormones going on you're thinking about the chicks you're playing Counterstrike there's a lot going on it's not just it's not just uh going into the server every day and the team's very young overall isn't there average age something like 19 yeah that's that is true it's 19.7 now yeah it's pretty nice to see their evolution like even the last two years even since they came into the scene like IC and the qualifiers for for the majors and then obviously did a lot of changes I think it's only like two players maybe that that are still around Blitz and 910 I think even 910 wasn't there I think originally like Annihilation stuff Tech they made a lot of changes obviously hasta was not the best one we all remember which is M's brother and that's also just I only learned that like way too late after after that happened I was like they replaced the brother with a brother maybe he was just holding a spot you know yeah keeping it warm waiting until he was 16 I'm not sure how old he would been in the time it says Bak is oh Bart oh sorry no sorry guys I forgot about bartak there spart he wasn't that good either he was no neither of them fit in particularly well no sorry sorry guys we're spreading fake news look at this is moso's brother and who is H's brother then I don't know nobody's H's brother maybe he doesn't have a brother what about Blitz does Blitz how sister perhaps who plays chess maybe that's what we'd be looking for no but I think I think um obviously the biggest news around it is people getting upset about the terminology from liquipedia um with it being like labeled as an S tier event which you know I think it's important that um the event is framed for what it is so I can understand why people are getting their panties in a bunch um but at the same time the the conversation for me is is more about the fact that this team are on the rise and what they're doing for the region is huge and with the conversations we were having last week about how things may be affected once you get into next year with no rmrs and how teams would be if you have an Asian team that is Con going to be potentially no RR yeah potentially Ras all of it is speculation obviously guys nothing we don't know anything just yet hopefully we know more more soon but with the way that I kind of see it going I think that would be huge for the region and there's a lot of talent within Mongolia and I'm not sure if they're going to be able to have you know another Mara but they definitely have a lot of players who have been through Mara uh who they might be at like atox is an example there was the the Huns yeah the Huns was another one which basically just a shitload of players who had played for the Mongols or IHC in the past yeah um so I me there are people like cabal and and those guys from the older older Mongolian teams that have plenty of experience even have been to International tournaments you know so they can pick up the mental for these second third best teams yeah I me it's just been I mean realistically first getting the third major slot and now this are the two best results for an Asian team probably uh aside of the the Renegades 100 teams guys right the Berlin major those those are the only like comparable results and to some degree it's not it is the same Asia Pacific region but like specifically for Asia like none of the Chinese teams did anything like close to this right and having this level of consistency between um in following events like sometimes they would have like a playoff run and like they had that Dallas uh not Dallas I mean Sydney um Sydney event where tyo reached the playoffs but never had the consistency and I think obviously with Mongols you have them at every event that they go to internationally they're always at least few wisting you know playoffs or close to playoffs and stuff like that so uh it's really it's looking very promising from from that side and you just got to give them props for the achievements right you can also you could also tell sorryi that they were getting getting hyped up for the major already a lot of the players that they were playing against in practice they were saying like I know our our favorite for the major kind of half jokingly of course but um you could tell that they were getting a lot of respect from from the other teams through practice and there's only so much you can say about practice results but if enough people say it about you then of course you have something going for you you know and and that maybe didn't uh necessarily transition or trans translate into a good result at the major itself they okay they made it to the second stage but that was pretty much the the the max achievement that they got because I think they went 03 after that um but now it's kind of slightly delayed they're they're getting some good results in with the playoffs run in pro league and now the couple of international tournament wins I think it's yeah I think it's great obviously you know if you look at how the Australia series went I think they I don't want to call it lucky because they did a lot to earn those like disadvantageous situations that they won towards the end of ancient but realistically realistically like five like four or the other five times they would play against asres they lose that series probably just because of the way that that asres threw some of these super advantages um that was a little bit disappointing on the other side yeah that was the series which was most interesting to me overall because during the group stage Mongols lost to them in the best of one uh but in the best of three this was one where they could definitely and it didn't start very well for them right I think the comeback on on Mirage that was that was good wait wait they won nuke yeah they won nuke a and then it went to anent as the third but yeah Australis were losing a lot of situations like remember there was a 2v4 retake of the B bomb site they were losing a lot of rounds that they they definitely shouldn't and they were just getting isolated like there was no trade potential in a lot of those scenarios they they weren't really playing off of each other and that's what made those possibility yeah the amount of solo du they got in disadvantages like Mongols I mean from Australis was crazy there was like three different rounds that would have probably ended the game or actually ended the game that you know should have gone the other way and they just didn't because they were just peing solo a lot of the time that was kind of crazy to see from a team as experienced and it was a tough series for device and I think you know that's that that's probably one of the I don't want to call it themes I don't think well I think it would be one of the things that people will point to if this continues to happen with aalis do we want to Pivot into this dra are we done talking about the Mongols I mean I I would I would also just give props to senzu because he was actually at the end of it even though stats didn't necessarily uh show that overall if you look a little bit deeper the the maps where he didn't turn up were like some of the ones that didn't necessarily matter in all the wins he was there he had he was the best their best player in the playoff run in those four map wins that they got on the way to I mean against Australis and nip and actually there was a dis like a pretty reasonable discussion that he could have been the MVP in the end didn't happen just because of the consistency from 910 but he was big further round mzo was huge to the run that was by far his best tournament so far possibly after the last after the Misa tournament that they won against bleed I didn't actually watch that one so I can't really speak to that too much but I think time zone wasn't conducive for that one I mean we were also Dallas I was also in Dallas at the time so it was impossible but I think M was probably the biggest like outlier compared to what we've seen before and if he he doesn't have to do this all the time for them to be competitive but at least if he keeps up a decent performances you know where he doesn't have so many disappearances like he used to in the first few events that he played with Mongols I think that's that's going to make them a scary team because they have enough depth with uh senzu 0 and Blitz even techno has has a lot of good games you know they actually do kind of take take turns a lot of the time and who's carrying the game so I think there's the depth of Talent with MHO also having some of these Peaks is pretty deep plus they're as you were saying earlier at the at the beginning of the conversation that they actually play good CS they do play Team Cs and and everything seems to make sense yeah uh there was something here I wanted to jump oh yeah with the positions binho plays he just he can't go into a game and get bullied or [ __ ] the bed one of the two right like because playing these anchor positions you definitely just can't get as long as he's get his one and delaying or maybe getting that necessary multi- kill that's the type of impact we're looking for from players like him in those type of positions um all right let's jump around a little bit I I think we might as well just pick up with the Australis point we can go to nip uh because I I want to go from you know well I don't want to say negative I don't want to go just positive positive and then just pile on with with it is it is a negative I would say cons like australas going into this tournament were clear favor clear favorites um so you know they just had that uh pressure on them to to win because no one else from the big like top 10 teams was was there if I look back at the rankings I don't know exactly but was heroic in a complexity after them yeah so they're definitely the biggest name there on a good like trajectory and everything and it looked like they're time to like grab a trophy and they' come third fourth at every event they've gone to right y there was a bit of a curse but okay so PSM Vibes exactly we could we could go down that angle and talk about a DEC ago but I don't I don't think look other than similarities and not winning uh that's probably the only thing that we're looking at right in that regard but for them I think the other events which were more stacked in terms of the teams which we were talking about and and bigger events and and differ in stages and all that kind of jazz um those some of those third fourths like changu for example uh you I think you'd wait them as better third fourths just like we're not waiting this event as an S tier event uh someone made a good comment just in chat just a little bit further up they said I think only CIT a clone and mages uh are deserved to be called S2 events I think that's that's pretty fair I mean it's all about like I hate these discussions because it's so like semantics it's like what do what do I think what something should be called it's like you call it whatever you want to call it and someone else is going to call it some something else uh but then everyone just gets upset about it it's like it's liquipedia standard and that's fine but it also it is it does does not feel you know does not feel real feel feels a bit too wide of a description of a description and it's also like the highest tier available right it's not like it's somewhere in the middle and then you can ah maybe you want to put it a bit up and a bit down um it does feel a bit disingenuous and I understand why people are like calling it out because I think that's kind of our job to say like yes this was great but it's not it's not this great they did not win a clone it's not close to winning a major at all it's or even any other any other what we would call a big event OB yeah it's not even like comparable to to to winning Dallas right it's not regardless of the priz pool it's JY 2K how how could it possibly be yeah but but in terms of the achievements and and the legacy of this win it's not on that level it's still it's still great it's still historic but you know we don't need to oversell something especially when it's great good it's a great achievement for the Mongols it's great for Asian Counterstrike and it's all more positive signs of where they're going as a team yeah it depends on the framing of what we're looking at it from so that for the Mongols and in their country and all the supporters and anybody who wants to see the Mongols do well and especially the team this is huge this is massive it's another step in the right direction to legitimizing them as the top Counterstrike team within the world and now if they go into the next big event right and they're able to look if they go into ying and they win again it's like holy [ __ ] okay [ __ ] like we're getting some consistency at this level and that makes it more exciting when you do get to a cologne you're like okay well now we're into to the to the events where there's a bit more pressure maybe if they make it to the stage there's going to be a big crowd how are they going to perform in those type of conditions and you know it's good Stepping Stones like this is [ __ ] the perfect conditions to a team stepping in the right direction to where they need to be to actually be a contender and if you can consistently from that region make it to playoffs of even just these events that we're talking about right then you go into big events you're able to do it then the upper event that's [ __ ] sick that's that's what we want to see I mean just to put it into context like there any pretty good teams that have not won a tournament of this caliber ever or in the last three years like for example complexity have zero land tournament wins even including like the dream hacks and stuff like that they have not won a trophy right Furia until like the Lisa tournament last year have not won a trophy in ages since like the online era as well right complexity also won online so these are like some of the stable top 10 15 teams super big investment and everything that have not managed to L A Trophy right and Mongols have done it in a in a tournament where for example both of these teams were competing uh Arris also I don't know when they they want something smaller I feel like recently but other than that it's uh it's a huge achievement regardless like and also it's an MVP event for us so it's like the first Mongolian player to to get an MVP which is kind of crazy I wish I knew how to say their names their names just look so like amazing it's if any like their actual not their aliases if people go and look at their actual names like I I couldn't I couldn't even try I think maybe MOS is the easiest aush bat Bal that's probably the easiest out of the bunch and and you you have to bet that that's not how he pronounces it either so no way no way in the world okay we were talking about Australis so this team with another third fourth what do we I think that the type of Counter Strike that they play in some of these games I don't want to call it a collapse now maybe I do want to call it collapse I've been watching the test for anybody out there who's a cricket fan I've been watching that on the Amazon primes um and and they use the term that when they're talking about the batting order collapsing what what do we think's going on with aralis in an event like this where they're going as the favorites is it still too early for this team is it is it acceptable for them to lose to a team like the Mongols I think it is I think it's acceptable for them to lose to a team like the Mongols I wouldn't cause it as like wouldn't go as far as to call it unacceptable it's more the way that they did because if they lost in a way where they just get outplayed at every corner like I can understand if if the other team has such a good game that sometimes it's just hard to get into it you lose all the key rounds you know sometimes it just games do go that way sometimes but it's more like device was such a disappearance and so visibly off that it almost made me think like is he sick again like what is what is going on with him because just pressure as a leader it could be could be that part of it as well um because but at the same time I mean even in the map that they won he wasn't really doing anything like it was such a disappearance series wide that I was just confused about what was going on there I don't think we've seen that from device in a long time regardless of what the status of the team was really so that that part was was curious to me I'd like to hear from him to because he hasn't really said anything ever since so that's my that that was my biggest takeaway from it because even on the ancient at the end of it he was missing some really bad up shots even his sprays with like AKs when he had Fairly favorable duels he just lost them because he messed the spray like people walking into his du stuff like that you know and of course A lot of it could be just like he's talking to someone he's trying to direct the the team at that at that time like those things will happen to Eng game leader sometimes but the situations in which it happened to him that like was not the case he was just about to go into a peak he was going for an opening just completely misses it you know things like that that were happening that just I couldn't explain Away by like the in game leadership perspective so I I don't want to put it all in him because it wasn't but that that realistically if he had even a decent game in that ancient they would have easily won it yeah I think if the team player was better on Ancient they would have won it as well because someone in chat said they had three uh 2v fours and one and one 3v5 I think it was 53 yeah and and that's that those type of rounds if you're losing multiple of those within a Ser within a within a series right like if we're talking across the court if you lost that many of it wasn't even like 10 within like 10 10 Rounds or something the last 10 rounds of ancient I think all of those happened there that's the thing do you can't really put that I feel like on on the IG no of course not no I think that's just like every player and especially the mid- round calls and it's like I mean to some degree obviously it's on the igl because he is also a player on the server so he can do stuff but it's usually those things are kind of in experience some of the players not really coming and I'm it's just like complete not guess but like down as a secondary caller is someone that you need to rely on in these situations I feel like well yeah he had a good series I thought he played well but like I I know that in the past he would just all of these xro guys would would get quiet and not really you know go through with some some of these micro decisions sometimes so hopefully hopefully it's not that but it could be as well um it could be down to just an experience as any game leader like sometimes if you are very experienced you will recognize those situations like if you will see um I don't know I'll throw out like an Alexi you know he would probably immediately say like calm down it's whatever it's a 4v2 like instantly there will be a call from him because he recognizes okay this is a situation where people can just over peak one guy over Peaks he could just stop it immediately you know but that's maybe something that will also come with time for for device because yeah you you just don't get to throw away so many of those situations and not get punished for it so um yeah this disappointing to see for sure especially because the inexperience angle doesn't really work for this team even stair now has quite a bit of experience on on this kind of a stage yeah Beast down I mean those are those guys have been playing device obviously those guys have been playing on the biggest stages for a while now for a couple of years for device even a decade you know at this point so uh that's that to me was the most disappointing thing about the STS well they also just just I want to ask they because they also played very close to against b boom right that that was the third map overtime win to to go through so I think that's also kind of a worrying sign so it's not just Mongols like bed boom have done kind of [ __ ] all for since they came together right this a team that they're supposed to deal with quite handily but it was looked pretty tight yeah I think I think I it's difficult to to condemn the Run of arral because it's another third fourth and as far how long has the team been together for now right not trying to make it down CH was their first tournament right and that was mon it was like about a month in since they replaced the BL map so yeah it's like three three four months something like that well the thing is you can definitely see there's a lot of the calling that they do that I think is quite like spawn based and they like to get start and I think it's always it's always nice when you can win games with like momentum calling that's a lot easier than having like default and mid- round or do everything like that I still think that there has to be an element of this that is uh the mental side and someone in chat was saying oh it can't really be an excusive device regarding the ingame leadership though because you've been doing it for a while I don't know if I'd consider doing it for three months as as a while right like I know that they've played a bunch of events already but this is still going to be a learning experience for for him and I would I know what you're saying the players are relatively experienced but for bro and stare as well I I don't I would bro is definitely unex inexperienced and stare I would I would lean towards inexperienced as well not putting I wouldn't say like they're in a position where they're primed and ready to start winning like the big events right now like they're they're in their progression phase I think a win for them is important right important for a couple of factors one to get the Reps under the belt uh for the likes of bro and stair in a bigger matches where there is more pressure it's going to be great for device to be able to call under more pressure environment and then also for him to be able to win a tournament go [ __ ] I just did that while oring an in game leading and then to also break through that threshold for the likes of of St maybe a little bit more so than yabi where he was one of the more later editions over there at heroic so he doesn't necessarily get the same tarnishing of the the brush as what St did because the big conversation around him is going missing in the bigger games um but it's important for Stan and yabi to get past uh that point as well based off of uh their history in in those type of games so some some tournament wins a win like this would have been a good one it would have been I think a catalyst for them to find a little extra bit of confidence but now they go into this final event of the year which we're going to talk about a little bit later of blast spring finals and they're look they're not in they're not in the they're not in the toughest well I don't know saws in there look it's na'vi asral phas and saw you would expect them to get out of that group and then make it to the playoffs it's another one of these [ __ ] 16 playoff brackets where they skip around and reasonably I think you'd probably expect them to be favorites going into the na'vi series at this point especially considering navi's form I mean if you even if you look at odds they're like 170 to 230 and they're slight whatever 55% favorites in that match and I mean that makes perfect sense if you look at the last couple of events for na'vi that was hardly anything uh uh anything impressive from them especially in Dallas when they go out to heroic you know like you understand a St loss but not to heroic that is playing with Nikos again you know so from that perspective I think they're even going into a place where they could and then then they're playing a phase team that they've already beaten a couple of times in changu you know and and have been comp competitive against so not like a group that they're going in as underdogs yeah so they're making another playoff appearance is very important yeah look I don't think I think it's still early in the development of this team but I think it's disappointing because it could have been an event where they won the trophy out of like all the events that they played so far this is the one which they had the clearest way of winning um and and lockings a spot within the final I think also if they did better within the group they wouldn't have found themselves on the same side of the bracket as Mongols and that would have been better as a grand fin fin even though we'll talk about NP in a second they played some of the best Counterstrike NP has played in in years uh but as far as Australis is concerned I me say the same for asales to be honest like for this whole season this is the best they have played since I don't I don't even know no but they had a couple of like spots little Sparks along the journey prop yeah they were like oh blame F and config they're good for one event boom playoffs y Bo you know there was a couple of those like little spots but I I just want to say like regardless of how blast goes unless it's like a complete I don't know falling fall apart scenario from asales like this season and the turnaround since um failing to get to the major I think has been incredible for them right we no one really knew how they could recover from from that and it was like everything was kind of on the line and they made one roster change uh added a new coach and like now they're competitive again you know table in the top 10 so I guess props for that yeah for sure uh okay let's jump into yeah let's talk about nip um I I don't think we're going to blow anybody's Minds if I went and said R wrinkle played good because wrinkle played good at pro league and wrinkle was one of these open names from uh Ukraine that we were talking about for a while I was like someone's going to pick this guy up um he's definitely got something to him I didn't realize he was as tall as a basketball player and got fired up all the time I've learned that about him over pro league in this event again he looks like he brings good energy to the team but wrinkle is a very exciting player to watch within that nip roster so I just want to reinforce that because for me he is probably the the driving force of the team the thing to get the most excited about but overall now that they actually have Isaac in the roster the pieces make a lot more sense which I think is what what we knew was happening anyway and Isaac is a player who has had uh some really big Milestones over his I I want to say short career but it's probably not a short career when you go back into like the of him coming out of tier 2 and everything like that right but obviously with the game Legion stuff over the last couple of years they've always been a Plucky team and especially under Ash as a coach I think this is something that really difficult for us to ever be out of frame and I love the fact that Ash is putting content out on his YouTube channel you get to learn a little bit more how his mind works as a coach but that seems like more of a system team where I would actually um contribute a lot of their successes or close games or victories when you wouldn't expect it or Star where they can grind matches out to the coach so with Isaac coming into this team understanding what he needs to do in the roster for it to work not to be like a because he's not a m he's not he doesn't play Massive frager positions right he is he your your especially when he was in Game of leion with Emma he would do a lot to support himma and set him up and help him feel quite comfortable I thought when Emma was gone you got a lot more out of Isaac and you saw some exciting moments and maybe you will get to when he is a bit more um comfortable in nip but nip at the moment that is going to be what I know we're just talking about this with asral but that's going to be their best result in absolute years like I I can't remember the last time nip ever did anything it was like going back to where device was in the team and it was in Stockholm just out of Co or something am I crazy is that was it that long ago I mean there there was actually that event that they they win it or did they finish second that was also in Abu Dhabi like a year or two ago that was like their last what oh I know what you mean did they lose to Mouse or something or did they win I'm going to go check but it was like a oneof it's not like a like it's not a relevant result but it's just funny because it was also in Abu Dhabi so um Abu Dhabi buff you mean Global Esports through Dubai yes that's the one they won that two years ago even now holy [ __ ] two years ago Max shy in chat found um yeah no I think I think it's pretty good again they they made a team that makes sense it's the bar is the bar is not that high like the bar to be the best team in the world is very high but the bar to just like compete is not be better thanp have been it's not that high it just has to make like kind of makes sense to if if you know if you go on the UN like cologne and you ask like everyone that's there about your roster and everyone says like this is weird as [ __ ] it makes no sense then you probably made a [ __ ] roster and I feel like that was like the last 10 nip rosters so now if you go around and ask people they have some Swedish Talent there some good oper blah blah looks kind of okay and uh it translates into actual results yeah for me it's it was watching wrinkle was really exciting I do think that he's kind of a a repeat defender in terms of over peaking um when he gets a kill he will always go for the second regardless regardless of the situation there were a few you know moments where he threw it away I think one of them even happening against the Mongols where it kind of gave away a free round for them where he was aggressing out of out of apps and he got one kill like on a guy who was walking into him and then he goes in peeking into t-spawn where another guy is waiting for him just kills him back and they give up the aide for it you know so these situations that kind of went the wrong way when he's like in this kind of a mode um but then again I'm also sure that with people like threatening exist behind him they will teach him how to strike that balance a little bit better it's a tough balance though that's one of the things that you never want to you never want to it's not that it's not that you don't want to teach your Ora when are the right situations to do this or not but you never want to do the scenario where they feel like you've gone too fast then they're never willing to take these chances because he had so many rounds where his impact is like ho he just won them around like that that 2K that's it he's just done it it's tough to that balance exactly but it's just about showing them first of all how to to take these risks better sometimes because sometimes it was just literally like a wi Peak because he was excited you know and like those situations where you're not supposed to where you you are supposed to calm down or at least you will take the peak in a more smarter way you know you're jiggle first then you will rep peek you know these type of things like he was getting very excited in in situations where more experienced opers would probably take that situation a little bit differently I do like that this is his mentality I would much rather have that than him being like I don't want to put him up against hetrick as like some big comparison but hetrick was obviously very passive never really did anything in terms of initiative in these rounds you know that were swing rounds while Rinko definitely has the mentality where I like I'm I'm I'm going to be the one who makes a play so I like that I like that mentality a lot it's very it makes for a very exciting oper and it also makes for like he has to be the type of an oper for this team because it's not like they don't have some Talent outside of that but they do need the oper to be their best player for them to have some success so he needs to be in the mindset where he has to take over he wants to take over games so from that aspect I like it I do think that he will learn because he's still very young he's still quite inexperienced he's 19 he has enough people around him that will help him with that um that I will like I will believe that he will get better at these things and he will just grow into a more like balanced oper as well like where he knows how to to take these risks and when and when it's when it's smarter to back off you know the one like we we're we're glaz and wrinkle right now but the one that I want to um you know feel a bit happy for is Alex right because I was worried that he would join this team and that nothing would ever because think about when he first joined think about how much of a [ __ ] show it's been yeah he's only been there for a short period of time right he hasn't been there for very long um and since September yeah it's like a three quter year think about how [ __ ] up it was for the majority of that time like only since they got Isaac has it gone oh okay well now now months ago now by the way what is it two months ago now what since Isaac's been in the team is it already been two months I think it's maybe not two months but uh it was like after probably that he got like 100% signed so a month ago three weeks ago that's a month yeah not two months sorry that is a month ago since they finished finished the team least they had the quarter they had the quarter Jesus yeah seven months for Alex two months for Maxa two months for wrinkle one month for ISAC so only in the last let's let's Round Up say two and a half months that things have actually started to come together uh so who was there when like Alex was there when config was there was there was everybody tag was there oh yeah They promoted esag at the same time or not promoted but got him back from the bench for a while myag was Elling before Alex came in no so it just I I just I'm happy that he gets to to to have a roster that makes a lot more sense now that's that's what I'm happy for that Alex gets an opportunity to try and lead a team where at least on paper it looks like it makes sense oh and you know what makes the most sense exist joined three months ago and since then they've signed Max to ring and Isaac yeah I did a little bit of a piece around it it's not something groundbreaking that we haven't heard from verman IP but kind of like going through their transition how they I called it resetting or like hitting the reset button because they went from changing the the staff behind the team from you know yunas Gunderson being out completely as the COO then they brought him brought in threat as the GM then Eric wend Eric Wendel or like before that Eric Wendel has was made the move up to to head of Esports or whatever director of Esports I think is is his title then they bring back threat then they bring on um exist as the coach and that's kind of how it starts right then they build the rest of rest of the team around Alex andas so I think there's there's a lot of more sensibility there let's say yeah what what what I guess the the one piece of this team and he is now a 26y old man but the IM Oakland 2017 major not major m 1997 Oakland MP yeah Rez re has been a part of this team for almost 7 years now six six years and 11 months and as far as months work guys when you get to 12 months that makes a year so we're so close to seven years which is insane that he has been a part of this team for that long but he had he had a decent showing I would say at this event like for for red standards it must be nice to feel uh for him as well that the team is a bit more cohesive around him right obviously it's not built around him or anything like that but to have the pieces that are working like your or are actually going for plays and making play like initiating rounds um so that that must be nice for Rez what's up Prof what's so funny and just look at the chat I am Oakland 2700 BC MVP 436 ad Ken MVP I am Babylon 2000 BC uh it is it is wild though like to think but yeah I don't know I don't know what else to really say about nip other than it was their best showing in while they played some good Counter Strike I don't want to I don't want to get too like hyped and be like Oh nip are back because I think this is one very small step for man I do think it's man I I do think it's a much bigger step than we would have expected going into it I didn't think they would make it to the final I just expected them to be reasonably competitive I wasn't even sure that would I mean I didn't think they were going to make it out of the group I just thought okay maybe they're going to take like a win over nip maybe they're going to win take a one win over heroic and then L I need to see this more times Striker I understand what you're saying in the sense that this is above expectations of what we had for the team but also going into this for a team like nip this is their Super Bowl we're talking about a lot of teams in this event having motivation to do well uh and some of them absolutely flopping um but they they they really probably wanted to do very well here but need to see it replicated at another event of similar stature before I'm going to get my you know exim meter clicking because at the moment cool we're in the right direction but how how how not even similar stature I feel like against some better teams they didn't really play any like great teams um maybe the is the best of one yeah the best of ones were like ANS heroic asres wins like heroic castres I think pretty good heroic I feel like I didn't really put a lot of stock in them at this event just because no you said that last episode yeah and everything and it kind of came across for Heroic and and complexity that they just crashed out and underperformed based on expectations and then the best of these were fanatic Fury and Mongols like okay but before this event we wouldn't be like ah if you beat Furia and fanatic that's going to be a great sign that's that doesn't mean anything to anyone right now right uh obviously both of these teams made it to the playoffs so it's a legit win and the final was pretty close but let's just see like how they deal with actually strong teams yeah and they have another quote unquote s tournament the head of them boy cus in like a week now I saw WR that he was going to Argentina I was like I thought I thought this I thought it first he going to Vacation yeah and then I saw the rest of the and I'm like is H of nip going on holidays like what what is this is this like old big do you remember when big used to do like Hol yeah that's before they they got rid of go I think they might be dead now no more no more just look at this holy [ __ ] I didn't even know this event existed wa that's an event that they like that's Now you kind of expected to make them them to make it to the final come on now I don't know if you expect anything this would be a chance for them this would be very important for them if they can clear the group right and it's only a four team playoff if they can clear the group and then if they can if they can make it playoff that's that's enough that's enough break expectations no because I think it's I think it's unrealistic like to to expect them to just we don't really know how to measure the form right it I I think I do think that it's also not the easiest group for them to be honest like pay and n9z have taken down some pretty decent names in the past so n in Dallas obviously now in Dallas but uh I mean biger was tearing it up at the major right so it's not like this this these teams are just throw away teams that they should beat any other day but you know after this there there's definitely a chance for them to make another Deep Run yeah I think if they make it out of the group they might they could get up against another fanatic again Ko's going to be there we're going to have some red kids there a bit of Imperial so okay I didn't even know that was going on fire League 150 Grand 100K first priz people just throwing money around aren't they they got moved like three times to be fair like it was supposed to be in Spain um or Portugal I think Spain it was supposed to be like 3 months ago that was the first plan but they they ended up moving it or

I hope so all right let's get things underway question number one before joining game Legion Isaac played for Lil mix medium Lobby big party uh should be Little Mix going to be selecting a little mix correct answer is Lil mix all I thought Li mix was only after that um but I guess it's been it's been around for a while I thought Lil mix was like a UK artist or something like that swed Swedish makes SL pretty serious theme for a while but I thought that was like after Isaac rather than during that time because Isaac's been in game Legion what for like three years a long time yeah a long time all right uh question number two for which of the following teams has Alex never played for Epsilon kick or ldlc that's tough hope he used the right Alex and didn't pick the the the British one I mean that's the that's the British definitely played for ldlc yeah he definitely played for ldlc but not the other two is this this is like one of those things where I'm thinking kick seems like so obvious that he should be there that he didn't actually play there but surely surely he must have been there at some point that's what I'm thinking I'm just trying to remember why played for ldlc that's what I'm trying to remember like if there's a chance because ldlc also at some point had like a European team so I'm just trying to yeah so I'm just trying to they were called like L DLC O whatever oh I will I will pick ldlc but I'm not actually 100% sure okay locking in ldlc and the correct answer is cuz it is the British that played there am okay nice little trick question for number two now in case you guys have missed this this appears to be a quiz about nip now it might be wrong you never know I might be wrong we might get the next question it's not about nip let's find out question number three who did resz replace on the nip roster in 2017 was it fryberg exist or dra well I'm assuming it was and dren 2017 is too early for that anyway dren was after that because res was the first like first new guy to come in when did exist stand in for phas I am Sydney 2018 yeah I think it's F I'm fairly sure it's fryberg for get R were they 100% I mean those two guys left quite a lot after that I'm trying to remember when exist left but I think he they one Oakland would exist as well would have been in game leading right so it would have been exist get Forest dren res bro I feel like I I think you're right with him you got I'm actually kind of 50/50 between him and exist I'm not 100% sure all looking in a fber correct answer is f yeah I was trying to remember the P like the winning picture from Oakland see the problem is but the problem is they bought both and they want one with fber so I remember the picture with fber so I just mind [ __ ] myself he he looks well he actually looks the same I was just looking at the picture of him MVP 2017 looks like the same guy he's just got muscles now that's that's probably the only real difference with res I would imagine uh all right question number four flying through these three from three so far after leaving nip how many teams did play exist did play exist before retiring as a player uh after leaving nip how many teams did exist play for before retiring as a player I believe that's what that's me to say how many teams did he play for man do I the standing count I don't know okay great well I guess he he played for faas right yeah but I don't know if that counts necessarily but he played for who did he play for that didn't did he play I'm try to remember he must have right because they they Hader and as the everyone except foren played in yes yeah so that's I mean I think it's two I don't think it was three more three or more I can't remember anybody else did he yeah he did play for ftic didn't he oh right I guess we'll see if face counts or not oh you locked in three or more well I guess it's just three who was in that fanatic team it was like he was there with even at some point no Crim dra was there at some point like outside of after JW but golden was was golden there when they won pro league who was there when they won pro league golden was there okay that was that was the last like last ditch from from BR I I feel like I feel like we should we should give this though because just ftic in phas right and pH is kind of like a standing so he played with Gen I feel like we should we should he played with geneng in [ __ ] flash that was also standing that was also standing I feel like we should give it I feel like we should give it because so I didn't know I didn't know the details couldn't give the details we'll we'll give this a how that his details there you go you hear it Lucas youve heard from the commissioner it's gone up to four all right question number five this is for the whole SCH smackeroo before joining bait wrinkle played for Gucci Squad e Kev or marlean S like a fish it is not guci Squad because that's that predates uh B predates that ecv was obviously a Ukrainian team but I don't remember him playing there who the [ __ ] is what is a malan I don't know I Googled it and I just got an Instagram of of a lady looks like a musicband God first queen God as B okay I will lock in NF just because that seems to make the most sense I don't actually know marlean so if that's that's that I've never heard of it I've never heard of Maran before all right the correct answer is Maran I want to I want to see who was on this roster are they even still a team there's there's X Maran and there's Maran oh okay so he would have been there when he wasn't there for such he there twice oh my God okay I don't remember this he was there and then he was did own get banned I don't think own got banned did he no I don't think so why would he have gotten banned I don't know I me because he was part of those several several zics was playing on that team by at the same time yeah I see okay I don't remember this whatsoever he was there so bro he was there for like two months what what is this question yeah I mean you should know better I guess so well four out of five that ain't bad uh we got to announce our winner and the winner is triangular another well May something that you would use if you went fishing triangular uncore uh out there for for a Maran congratulations you didn't get the $50 voucher you only got the $15 voucher but I hope you can use it and I hope you can buy yourself something nice all right that's who to be a skin brought to you by tr. someone Chad just tagged the guy said [ __ ] you triang why so every everyone's just here man have a go um all right let's let's keep moving do we want to talk about some of the I think we should probably talk about eternal fire I don't know if we need to talk about an it was their first event as you mentioned before Striker with potty and sdy so I don't want to I didn't actually catch a lot of their games either I watched like one one of their games so I'm not sure what to think is there Seas no they're doing the are they also playing um they're playing un shipping are they yeah not showing up on the thing yeah in the same group as mibr Alliance I guess that that's we can give him that more that event and then we can make some you know make some conclusions also at the same time as blast no never mind you just act as if we did the downfall was Cito at the start of this year that's where it all went wrong for an to be completely honest with you guys uh all right so there was there an interview with eternal fire or am I dreaming because yeah yeah there there are a couple of interviews did they did they put out a sentiment where they said something along the lines of we we don't do well and we're favorites kind of under something like that major said that they don't they didn't I don't think that they don't they said that they don't do well it's more like they didn't do well now that there's pressure on them you know I don't think he necessarily made it meant it as an excuse it was more like something like like we should have performed now ex but we didn't and he's just acknowledging like yeah this was our chance it's kind of like what we spoke about aalis it's kind of the same sentiment where he's like this is this was our time to to shine kind of we earned our spot to be here and we didn't take yeah you know we played like [ __ ] I do agree with that sentiment as well because even when I was building my fantasy I thought a lot of those matches were super 5050 between the entire group b because it was like fnatic a complexity that just came over from Dallas Eternal fire um who was there who else was there I'm actually forgetting half of the group now uh B yeah honestly they should have owned the [ __ ] out of that group they that's what I was thinking as well I thought if they're not going to win it they're going to be second third easily and then they're going to do doing decently well in the playoffs because they've just been trending up they won the CCT event online or not they they beat some really good teams so I also thought that's that's their chance to to go for another Deep Run and yeah they just [ __ ] the bed the most disappointing result of the event probably yeah um zantar was also he was good and the games W stopped mattering really we were just going through that he was really terrible in the two Inferno losses that that ended up costing them a chance to make it to the playoffs so that's also kind of outside of outside of the norm for them because they usually do rely on zantas to to put up the numbers so when they don't have him it just seems it just seems they're kind of screwed which is a shame because wardia was meant to be the second coming and uh it'd be good if we and think I'm still a bit on defense for that by the way I yeah because he's always been very up and down and it's like he has one good game one bad game he never seems to he's never seemed to find that consistency and uh this event was another example of that um dude he's been in the main roster for over a year now yeah he's been there for a while I don't think I don't think that there's no future there or anything like that I'm just saying I'm waiting for a bit more from him because I know that people have been exactly helping him up because of the G good games he has but he also has just as bad games to to counterbalance that a lot of the time so uh just lacking the consistency yeah okay yeah I think that's probably the most disappointing result for me because I thought they're on a on a good trajectory I think this will set them back at least as far as uh the the general Community uh consensus is concerned those aough kind of kind of unrelated but related I just got a DM on uh on HL TV and someone blinked the thread and said why is this deleted and uh it's a guy asking for us to add uh add Kebab image to hltv logo on World Kebab day 12th of July to celebrate this very special day and support Turkish fans of Cs around the world uh so today I learned that 12th of July ke his ke and I googled it I Googled it and I was like is this is this some kind of a joke is like is it a you know a meme is it going to be like National Turkey day but no it is it is just Kebab day that exists apparently International days for everything man yeah I just brought up the list that United now you know yeah but there so crazy how many things there are like what are we right now where are wee what's today June 10th June 10th is nothing but 11th is International Day of Play okay what kind of play I don't know let me have a read there's also a different day for international day of masturbation so uh play makes a better world the first ever International Day of Play to be observed on the 11th of June oh this is the first one first ever w Mark is significant milestone in efforts to preserve promote and prioritize playing so that all people especially children can reap the rewards and Thrive to their full potential okay I can support that kind of a day I support that day you know what follows International Day of Play what follows International Day of world day against child labor that's the next day that is uh that's that's two days that children gets in a row Jesus there's I intern I don't even know how to pronounce this word but it's I I guess it I'm going to link it see if one of you guys is brave enough try read it there you go um albinism yeah that's the one the I wouldn't have done that I I don't know where I would have taken to trying to pronounce it but Alm or albinism I don't know albinism aware day [ __ ] hell there is a day for everything World Blood Donor day world elder abuse awareness day elder abuse awareness that's no I know you're not abusing your elders but who's abusing their Elders what the [ __ ] all right well uh that we're getting slightly off topic I mean we can we can save that for later of the abusing Elders because we're going to talk about Taz on G2 so okay keep it in the locker for now yeah all right all right I wna I want to just let everybody know um something before we get into the next we're gonna be doing a bit of a review of the season so far Prof got in the in the workshop was doing up a spreadsheet not a spreadsheet Google but before we get into that I was I recently um I listened to a podcast with a gentleman called Craig Jones now I want to let everybody know I'm not into Brazilian jiu-jitsu at all but I just listen to like any podcast I like listening to people talk and apparently he's like an Australian Brazilian jiujitsu I think they call them players I don't know maybe that's wrong but anyway I started learning about the Brazilian jiu-jitsu drama right there [ __ ] popping off at the moment sick like I can't get enough of it I'm loving it and I learned that motar 2K the 2K okay is an organizer of one of the biggest Brazilian jiu-jitsu events in the world the ADCC no way legitimately and he's been doing it for years is he under the same name still people know people know him as motar 2K from the time but it's it's his name is like Mo Yim or something I don't remember but I learned and I just it kind of just blew my mind so I wanted to you know that probably 90% of the listeners do not know who motar 2K is well that's a shame he donated 50 Grand to passer one time yeah I mean I don't even know yeah how to even explain it's just the random guy was donating a bunch of money to some of these like at the time streamers who were kind of starting out only started to be popular I think he donated to flush like 20K as well like some of these Pros that um that he wanted to support he just donated a whole bunch of money to he's on the wrong side of this drama apparently his organization is not paying the fighters enough and that's why this Craig Jones individual has started up his own and he booked it on the same weekend in the same city it's in Las Vegas and he's he's paying all the fighters who are just going to show up the same as what the fighters who win get at at moo 2k's event plus $1 and then the grand prize is a million dollars so that's what I I learned recently while I was down my rabbit hole yeah this is like cter strike politics uh you know trying to P push each other out of this out of the thing offering offering better things to players and all that stuff that's what we're getting into for 25 by the way oh yes yeah yeah yeah the dick measuring competition of prize money and player conditions and everything like that uh all right let's let's jump in and let's uh let's do you have the link Lucas by any any chance I had it um I'm going to just put it thank you very much so Lucas we're going to go there and go to slide number three if you could and we'll we'll just go through them from 3: till 9 UM and we can just talk about some of the the victors that we've had throughout the year so one of the things we wanted to do right now and and I think I brought this up last week was we need to we right on this show and I guess Counter Strike as a whole need to do a better job of um framing the importance of events before they're about to happen or as they're happening or or what it means within the context of a season or where we're at in the context of a year in the Counter-Strike world and right now we're about to go into the tournament break in a week's time that's going to be starting after blast ends blast finishes on the 16th of June and we're going to talk about that after this little bit so the tournament break starts on the 17th of June and it's going to run all the way up until ewc starts uh so teams will be flying out for ewc I think on the 15th of July I think uh and that means that the tournament break will be ending on the 14th now that entire time is obviously not just them not playing or anything they probably going to come back a week early and get some practices and everything like that um say as you say it's not player break it's a tournament break that's why I'm using tournament break I hopefully I was stuck to that uh but yeah one of one of the key features of of this year which is different from the previous is uh having the change of calendar regarding the second major of the year which will then in future always be as far as the foreseeable future goes the majors will be the last events of the season and that's also bringing up some of the changes we had in last week's episode we're discussing open qualifiers and that we predict that there might not be the RMR and the events will have to all have open qualifiers and that's all going to factor into the rankings to qualify for Majors so we're in a pretty big period of time right now in terms of what's going to shift going into 2025 um and where we are in 2024 is these partner teams need to be building teams that are going to be competitive at the tail end of this year to qualify for this major that'll then hopefully have the flow and effects to help them qualify for future majors and events uh going into 2025 at least that's that's where I'm standing so let's reflect uh on the start of the year and the first one we have on the screen right now is I am Cavita which was a historic event obviously because of the performance of Don and spirit lifting the trophy and thinking at that point oh [ __ ] we might just have the best day in the world here and they could go on to dominate um the first season which hasn't ended up to really be the case by any means has it I I don't think anyone dominated the season if you're completely clear I don't think you can say that there is one team that is the best overall I mean we'll go through the all of the big tournament victories and maybe we can kind of talk about that but I still I don't think we have like a clear front runner there's a lot of you know distribution between the teams and like maybe some like interim number ones but no like true number one in terms of I mean someone needs to be the best you know someone is always the best but there is no like clear Champion I would say of this season yeah I think if you if we were to do like our top 10 teams of the year at this point and just go through the ranking and how the season went I I would my best guess would be it would be phas just because of the amount of finals they also had one title on top of that so from that perspective I think that's relatively obvious that they they would be the the number one like as from how many points they got on the ranking throughout the season so far but obviously it's only one win it's only one tournament win um it's not the major as they were supposed to but they do have a major major runnerup they have a couple more runner-ups from Kavita so from that perspective I think it's obvious that we do have the best team of the season but it's not a dominant team of the season well I think something with looking at this this event win in itself obviously with with phases a runner up that that adds to the stock because this is an S tier event you guys like what I did there this is this is for sure an S year event there's no you know doubts about it and one of two in the first six months of the year right because the other one is obviously the major uh so I think for Spirit to win this was massive because of uh kind of the history that was made regarding individuals like your ztics more importantly your donks with that that kind of insane performance um but then looking back with with hindsight to see the way that things have kind of trickled forward it hasn't gone maybe the way that we were expecting it to go at the time um but yeah that is one of the biggest events so you you can't really take anything away from that right so you would have to put a lot of stock into that Victory and then I guess we can kind of flick through let's head to the the next slide Lucas if we can uh and this isn't in order uh by any stretch that's fine in order to be fair let me let me fix this all right all right all right let's go pro league this is after pro league okay so to the major we can go to the major all right okay all right well we well Prof does that we can I feel like someone someone [ __ ] around with this I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna put I'm gonna point a finger somewhere okay you know what happens when you point a finger for facing back at you yeah that's true yeah uh okay so then we have the major which is the the na'vi victory but FaZe in another grand final now this one this one is a curious one because it was the second major victory for uh na'vi you had JL as the MVP extremely unlikely they won the event with their rifler who played star positions on the team having pretty pedestrian statistics uh it's fun story lines for the likes of wonderful blade Alexi different reasons what do we make of this because as far as I mentioned Cavit was an S event well this is an S tier plus event so this is a gold MVP coin event yeah a gold MVP coin event yeah okay well with with this major win right earlier on in the season and what's happened for n since another one of these what do we even do with this type of result right and season has kind of just added to the stock uh to the fluke stocks unfortunately yeah I think it's it's also quite comparable to this Dallas win in that the individual performances across the board don't really add up to a win like if you look at was it less than 50% of rounds won right that also like helps helps explain that I guess that they actually didn't win more than they lost to win to to get this win which just can happen in CS it's not it's not completely unheard of but uh it was completely unheard of the majors I think up until that point um so from that perspective I think in and not meaning it in any sort of a bad way just because yeah I don't think that there's uh it's fair to call a major win a fluke a lot of the time because you you had to had to do a lot of things right at that tournament to win the MJ they Peak oh yeah that's it isn't it they PE to that event exactly yeah as I said a lot of things went right same way a lot of things went right for for G2 dolls that you know in the same way might not go right again um but they did you know they were there to to take that opportunity um I was gonna make a point off of this and I forgot what it was sorry St my bad yeah that's all right I mean it's uh what what I yeah it's realistically no one expected na'vi to win there does it join the likes of gamber winning does it join the likes of you know is that what type of major win it is I think Gambit and even there's another one even or Outsiders whatever would have been another one those are the three main ones that people probably talk about when it comes to Major flukes right like if you compare to Gambit pretty much fell apart instantly right after that even with before they had a chance to play anything else Ze left for for back to Nai because they wanted to kick Kane uh Boston Cloud9 fell apart pretty much right after that without even playing anything else like for some reason team just didn't get along already going into the major they were supposed to break apart suddenly you know they they just go on this crazy run the only one that maybe VP also change pretty pretty I think well it was like the next RMR so that's still like half a year before they made any changes and honestly I mean if you look at the trajectory of na'vi you can't say that they're not on the same especially with what blade was saying like this next upcoming season is going to show whether we need changes or not if this is the na'vi that we should expect now after the major because I mean they made playoffs in pro league but it wasn't anything impressive they got out of um Dallas quite quickly with a loss that they like one of those series that they probably shouldn't have lost the heroic so there's definitely a lot of proving that they have to do to to themselves as well to see if they can replicate some of this um so yeah I mean of course it's that's what's going to what people are going to say until you get up to a decent result again unless they make a final like in the next couple of tournaments people are those voices are just going to get louder I feel like they're blast is going to be important even though it doesn't feel like it even though they're trying to downplay it like Blade with the comments and everything I don't really buy it honestly if they go to win the major and then they can't do anything else for the rest of the season or the the season before that like they didn't do anything for the whole season practically except winning the major I think it's obvious what the limits of the team are and it's not winning the major that's like everything clicked once in a you know once in a lifetime situation that happened and there's obvious like obvious players to upgrade let's just say that yeah uh sorry I I just went through my emails and I have an email and I'm not going to read the person that sent me the email but I will read the contents of the email because at no point they said you can't talk about this and I also have no way to validate if any of this is even legitimately true and why would you email me this if you didn't want me to talk about it okay so it says hey Chad we can skip the bit where he's being nice to me um I'm friends with someone on M80 and just wanted to let you know some insight G2 minus hooky minus Nexa plus Mals don't know about the in-game leader though thought you might find it interesting buy out is 500k let me know if you have any questions that's just a r apparently that's just a random email that I got like so from they that could anybody anybody could go to my Twitter and find my business email and send me that email how do we rate this rumor I rate this like two out of eight mate [ __ ] I I I just thought plus mobs that's it yeah that's all it said yeah and money no in game leader to come oh it's Nico I forgot there you go Nico's in game leading now uh oh my God I can't what do we think okay this is this rumor kind of side what if there's [ __ ] it we're going to talk about the situation later I'm not going to get into it okay all right all right uh let's jump to the next slide I don't oh someone asked a good question what does it say about FaZe that oh actually we can do it in the next one let's go to the next slide okay yeah go to the next slide so FaZe is winning chungu and beating up their little brothers of ma broie being the MVP but there the 10th time that year and look at look at Neo's arms but other than Neo's guns uh I think we need to talk about the question that somebody posed in chat just moments ago and they asked the question what does faas coming second all these times mean for their season obviously they won this event but what like if you're if you're you know rarely the bride more often the brides made what what what does that say it shows that fazeer always consistent even actually let tape it off in the last couple of events hasn't it well it's still still quarterfinals in the last couple of events sound like it's been bad in the pro league was it's more the jalas one that really sticks out just because in pro league they lost to zyu who was just [ __ ] destroying in Dallas it was modesty he was [ __ ] destroying but it was also a team that they probably shouldn't have lost to otherwise you know with vital at least they've been going kind of kind of back and forth and there's some legitimacy to that result uh so I don't I wouldn't say that their tapering off is that significant obviously they were already on a massive High leading up to that and that major would drain you a lot I think that's that's probably the one that that took a lot of wind out of their sale I mean k has well especially the way that they lose these Tournaments has to take a massive toll on you I mean even the Dallas one you just get absolutely obliterated by G2 playing with a stand and that's going to take something out of your mental and I mean they've already talked about it as well that they're just not you know they're not treating each other the same way they're not um having as much fun in like their practice rooms and stuff like that and I mean if you lose enough events like this it's going to happen that maybe the Vibes aren't going to be the best because you're just losing events where you is going to get zero3 bi a Spirits BL decider C like against na'vi and then this what happened in Dallas against G2 so it's those are some tough losses to take all the way at the end of the tournament where or at least close to it season yeah where where it's just you know you're close to getting another title and this is what stands in your way and you weren't even close to it that that's got to be that's got to be tough the cool thing about the cool thing about this conversation we're having right now is uh it puts really good framing for the last event of of the Year oh yeah right which we're going to talk about soon which males won't be at who were the runners up here sorry prop what were we gonna say I mean when you look at FaZe what name comes to you thinking like who is not performing this season I don't think it's like oh okay who's part I think that one's obvious okay who is it robs yeah I mean considering his level for hisel right because uh obvious I don't want to be like a stats reader but I am so [ __ ] it I'll just do it um in changdu he was pretty good 114 but that was also like a tournament where broy broi really did amazing and he was in one of one of those broky tournaments where he just does whatever he wants and it works um and uh but robs uh the tournaments where they should have done better so the major 105 rating pro league 109 Dallas 106 right for for Rob's standards pretty pretty underwhelming katav 111 was pretty nice and that's kind of his average for this year but it's mostly like put up with some of the the imrs and some of the smaller tournaments right so it is an interesting thing to like keep in mind especially considering early on in CS2 robs was like we even did that article like you know that apex apex didn't really like But like after two tournaments you know robs is the best player in CS2 right now um and he was right at the time so since then after the kind of the initial transition he has not been I feel super comfortable or super happy or super in his Zone um which is definitely taking away some of the potency from from FaZe he is I mean the reason why they can't play the way they play which is like pretty a lot of defaulting a lot of just relying on the individuals is because the individuals are sick um and then one of one you could say maybe even the biggest star on the team is not performing to to his standard level that's automatically gonna kind of limit the potential uh of the lineup I do think that brok has stepped up compared to last season or last year at the same time because I mean at this point he's kind of on course to be like a top five player of the year props was number three last year obviously quite very far from that at this point because he doesn't even have any EVPs at the moment and that's we're basically at the end of the first half of the Season which is kind of crazy to to think about that he still has hasn't been getting hasn't gotten any awards has no EVPs he has zero EVPs for the year that's kind of crazy yeah oh he has a lot of like strong VPS where he's just just on the edge of that uh for the couple of those events where they went far he he did well I think K is one of them Majors I don't know about the major actually I don't remember exactly which events but a bunch of these events where they went where they went far uh he was just a strong VP but never really got over that hump just because his consistency definitely faltered he's also not as good in big matches which was a his big Plus in the last year's top 20 where that kind of that's kind of what made him top three um over Mony that was at the time right yeah um so that's also something that's faltered he hasn't been having so many big games so I don't know what what that's down to exactly because it doesn't seem like I mean none of his positions have changed maybe just slightly with Rosen coming in things are are a little bit different here and there he that's actually something that possibly can point to just because twist was the guy who was supporting him the previous year and obviously it was working out very well for him at at the beginning of CS2 is that the only reason why he's suddenly not performing as well is frozen either not going doing as as good of a job of supporting him or is their Dynamic just different compared to been some changes in positions though like rain plays a with now and I think that some of the things is like I don't know how to quantify and I can't like I wasn't in the server I wasn't but you could look at ways that um twists would do things with RS or for RS I'm not saying that other players aren't I just don't notice it as much as I did when I was watching they did share a lot twists and robs used to share a lot of positions C side especially yes well but that's that's where I think you're going to get your best out of RS right I don't think you're going to get your best out of RS on the T side I think you know you get the three players we spoke about this like to ad noran right you just want to get Frozen uh robs and broi in the mid round so they can close out those rounds but on the CT side I think is where you expect more from player like robs right to be able to lock down a lot of situations but also robs in certain positions I remember a couple years ago I was looking at who like the best apps CT players were on Inferno and at the time it was robs shush and jks and shush was really passive and then and uh robs was actually the most active which you wouldn't really think of like a player like robs right he was the most active in the halls and the Boiler Room position always taking a lot of fights but he'd be set up with boosts like they do the one way when you had the old smoke or they' do the double crisscross NAD mid or he would do a lot of these pushes and then JS was the most in between like you know he would go pass aggressive some rounds passive in other rounds he would have the most uh Variety in that regard but I think like I don't know with the changing team if there's just more individual owners at the moment right while things are being settled in but I imagine this team that carrian um discussed is going to have some big ramifications in how they approach going forward right the 2hour debrief or what the Yeah Yeah I think that's going to have some like some really positive things right just to to get out like all the dirty laundry essentially and let everybody know how you're feeling about certain things it's a good way to also it's the first time in two years which means they've obviously done a very good job of managing that up until this point but things can things can build things can definely build course I mean especially as I said if losses like that they do take a massive mental toll and it that's always going to cause some friction and that's a lot of the time that's for the better as well like people do need to figure out what the problems are for them to get better through improve relationships or dynamic inside the game whatever it is you know you have to talk through problems otherwise you will never be able to fix them so I think we will see we will get into blast a little bit later but I think if we see some changes in terms of positions at at at at blast that's probably the result of those talks where you know maybe robs is feeling like he would work better with frowen in certain positions or whatever it is you know that that they might come to to results that that will probably tell us a lot already all right let's uh let's start zooming through we still got a couple of these to get through here uh the next ones I guess we can go a bit more swiftly through because it's back toback M trophies Lucas so let's go like six and seven uh is so pro league for ma uh beating Vitality but they dominated I think that's one of the keys here Z we still getting the MVP and then b boom they also dominated in and these are both best of five finals against spirit with Don as the MVP so ma in these events I think some of the key factors for me which stood out and we can actually talk about these guys with it being the end of their season because after they decided not to practice for Dallas that was the end of their season um and that's probably the worst thing they did all season was not practice for Dallas because the team was playing Mega confident counter- strike um even got to the point where things look like they were so ironed out with this addition of Brolin that shuy was able to uh play really good individual CS himself and and make sure he could contribute everybody was happy to find taking a lot of jewels a lot of these tournaments I was at where I could stand and I could listen pro league would be one especially uh lots of ideas you can hear like toi calling his picks a lot of the time I think that something we've discussed with this team for very extended period of time is how mature they are um in terms of how they hold themselves in the way they talk about Counterstrike but the biggest problem for Ms and the biggest bit of condemnation even with the chungu uh final against FaZe is the the fact that it's like these big stage events is where we would have loved to have seen them lift a trophy like this going now into next season where they won't have another opportunity until cologne and that's an event where they could have potentially being in conversation of content they're currently the number one team in the world but without them getting a victory on a bigger stage event it's hard for me to back them in as one of the one of the favorites in in that sense I'll always have that little issue kind of hovering over over the head with yeah but I think that you know they had a very good season to see us and this broling pickup has worked better than I thought it it's it's worked out great yeah for sure I imagine we also we will hear a bit more about that soon enough um but I don't think there's going to be anything standing in the way of broland Mech actually making the move or like permanently actually being able to to get a contract with mous so I would imagine yeah during the season I would be surprised if we didn't hear more about that I'm uh just about the break that it was kind of it was telling because there was um there was an interview with broland at bbom if I remember correctly where he was like yeah the the amount of travel in tournaments that they're playing is getting a bit you know it's taking a toll um and then they won bed boom and after that took the little like few days off didn't practice until until Dallas and then came kind of rusty um not saying it's a good idea but it was kind of there were some signs that things were boiling right under the surface and I guess they just wanted to protect the players and avoid like burnout but it it is kind of underwhelming um in the story of this team and the season that they didn't really do anything in Dallas like literally especially when that that was supposed to be the last event they're not even playing out the entire season because there's like two events right after that they're still tier one that they're not mentality we call that the what [ __ ] made mentality oh [ __ ] made I've never heard that before I just think I think the kids are saying it I just thought it you know I'd bring it in I don't know if the kids are saying it or not I feel very old right now yeah yeah I don't know it it's just bad decision talking about the kids uh I saw you child at some point in Dallas and you rocked up to the bar with a skateboard on your back oh yeah not my skateboard it was such a hello fellow kids moment it was [ __ ] hilarious yeah that wasn't my skateboard that was uh Ben uh audio Jesus we call him that was his skateboard that's how also I have to tell a story I don't know if if it's going to be as funny as it was when I saw it in real life but also in Dallas obviously the bar Hotel it's very it's very crowded everyone's coming in a lot of players a lot of other people at some point there's next to me there's like a two people standing a girl and a and a man and a girl woman even holy [ __ ] I think so I don't know anyway floppy is walking towards this person this person is like turned turned back floppy is coming back from the back okay and floppy Taps the person on the right shoulder but walks on the left left side ah the classic but he walks past and just continues walking it doesn't stop so this person turns around is like and and does a three doesn't like stop does a full 360 does that turns back around floppy is already out of the room like out he he's gone and this person is like who the [ __ ] tap me it's impos doesn't know doesn't know who it was probably doesn't know till till this day who tapped the shoulder and floppy just like casually strolled by it was one of the funniest things okay one of the funniest things I've seen in my life guy um I don't know I I would presume so we'll never know yeah okay it was it and no one except me saw this I was like in the middle of a conversation just saw this no one else paid attention to this like genius interaction that just happened the smoothness like Smooth Criminal okay well floppy shout out to you I guess mate uh smooth moves just dipping and Diving all right well I don't know where where we go from there into floppy is so cool so people like the story that's into slide eight um and then once we get once we get slide eight on the screen uh this one ah [ __ ] the haters this one is more condemnation for Vitality than something to celebrate for G2 but we'll celebrate it nonetheless um so Vitality don't have a trophy this season couple they' had two opportunities two finals and they don't have a trophy yet and this is their best bet the males final they got blown out of the water but that was against a full roster this was an opportunity against the team with a standing I understand the scenario regarding the crowd etc etc but still should have been their uh their trophy to win so this for me this event is more about the Mony MVP which also will be a factor in our discussion about Blast coming up in a moment um but more so condemnation for Vitality not lifting that that trophy when they had that opportunity and it might come back to haunt them with the close of the Season just around the corner so that's my take away from Dallas and should we just jump into the last one then we can talk about blast yep and the one that we just did yala compus um it doesn't really matter because we're not going to see either of these two teams at blast so done all right great now that's the season in review everybody now we're going to jump forward and we're going to start talking about blast oh no what we do what of the odds do what of the odds now uh we can do that when we talk about G2 it's it's G2 one so we can do that all right all right well I get let's we should start with that let's start with G2 because obviously the news that came out today and we saw this probably a week ago maybe a little bit more than a week ago uh that Mony would unlikely would would be not be with the team uh in London now let's let's call a spade a spade let's talk about the elephant in the room monesy is Russian he is going to the UK I imagine that's probably where we had some complications regarding the Visa um so they are going to be using their coach this time Taz to stand in and they will not be using Stewie 2K to the community's dismay I can't believe they didn't get sm why didn't they get sm they could have just just signed for a team like it would make sense it would make sense you also have to consider roster locks they probably didn't expect this by the time that they could have added for who gives a [ __ ] about roserock tell that to every all all the tournament organizers man I absolutely agree with you but that's how today's world Works in Counter Strike you don't get to make any changes regardless of what happens to your team it doesn't make any sense yes I agree with Ian there's also the emergency stuff like yeah but nobody really considers an emergency because you're also putting in your coach as your actual standin because that's just how it works as long as you have a coach you apparently also have a stand in even though that's absolutely not the same thing they just need to like break taz's leg or something and then they can get a I don't know I don't know under circumstances they would actually be able to make a change because uh I don't know who else they submitted actually I didn't see the the lineups for for BL if there's somebody else um for that it's um yeah I would have to see the the lineups for um for blast but yeah I hate this as well because you could actually get somebody decent and not have to play with your coach next JY 2K no let's just say what do you mean they want an event with him Prof you let let's just say you know there will be an a a portion of people are going to be like oh but they did it with Stewie in Dallas but they had Mony and now that they don't have Mony this is going to be so trash this is going to be this going to be so bad my curiosity is obviously how they solve the situation you know because there's a number of ways they can go about it and I was thinking about like what is the most likely and I actually don't know if you've seen the stown solution I actually like that a lot except for one small detail which is that Nico would be in game leading so stown solution he he tweeted something got know was yesterday two days ago I remember um he was actually he was actually the first one who set it out right that modesty was not going to make it even modesty was very very vague about it uh St solution was uh hookie goes hookie takes it up has goes into Hook's positions Nico stays in Star wars Star rolls but igls as well so outside of that igl thing I actually do think that this would make the most sense for G2 if Taz just picks up hookie positions and hookie just takes over like m position takes up the op whenever he's needed obviously know I don't expect modesty to the hoaxy to just suddenly 100% op and just prioritize every round and all that stuff but I do think that in C certain T rounds like that probably makes the most sense for him to pick it up just because it's the path of least resistance and the path to utilizing Taz in the most effective way because you can't put Taz as an oper that's pretty obvious he's just going to he's never been an oper he's never done that before and obviously we don't expect this outut to be any better than hookies if anything probably a lot worse considering he hasn't been playing and his output by the time he retired was worse than that and I guess worst teams his last game was over a year ago and like March 2023 and for 2023 he averaged a 0.83 rating so and playing against like tier three teams on average so himie plus like Nexus form God bless us if if Nexa plays like he played in Dallas is going to be awful um I I kind of do want to do what we did uh before Dallas but this time it makes even more sense like they are going to get [ __ ] blown out it's not going to be fun to watch at all especially because the teams in their group are Vitality versus Pro and spirit like there's no and spirit is first too if it's like VP first I could imagine them just kind of sneaking out of at least a map win or something but they're like completely outmatched here so it it's it's kind of sad honestly that this is how G2 season ends like this uh weird Stewie win and then they can't even build on it at all it's um actually pretty frustrating uh from a from a pundit and viewer you guys ugly haters man the JSU are going to win the whole event Taz is going to be dropping 40 every game he's going to be doing it all Nico is going to have godl numbers NEX is going to be clutching hookie he's gagging to get back in the server after the whole Stewie thing that's extra motivation for him H's impact is going to be off their chain they're going to win the whole event guys they're the whole event I actually do think that like as much as obviously their output is is very likely to be terrible I am curious what kind of an effect it's going to have on Nico and Hunter because I assume that they will have probably a bit more agency without Mony on the map uh that could also mean a bad thing because they're also not going to have the support of Monas even though he's not necessarily that kind of an oper a lot of the time but I am curious how they're going to work on tside because I like it's obvious that they will have to do more a lot more and NEX I will have to do a lot more for them to even begin to try to make up for the massive difference that is minus Mony plus Taz it's like a player's worth of difference effectively like top top 20 players worth of difference yeah it's more than one player is worth of difference yeah honestly um especially with the form that Monon now where people are starting to call him the best player in the world so it's it's it's obviously super hard to see them winning even one map against either of these teams I have a great sorry I got a great comment uh from Bobo bonsky binsky good name he says Taz will destroy VP like it's 2017 all over again wow okay hope rocks up in a BMW that's a banger yeah look um what's what's the point didn't didn't Dallas teach us anything gentlemen what's the point of giving a legitimate opinion that's pointless yeah exactly I know honestly it's I think it makes sense because uh then we by saying something is is very unlikely to happen we create the The Narrative and like when when it ends up happening that it's so much more exciting you want to be in the when such and such plays Counter-Strike click why make that for I was just thinking about that today make that for that compilation for for G2 and D but they did twice super did it vital did it no but they didn't do that it's too good maybe people are too young these days Prof they've forgotten about the Cs okay I thought you yeah I got it yeah but um look I couldn't imagine how I I just wake me up from this dream I I I don't I don't do you see them do you see them winning a map against VP no you see them squeaking out of mapw no I I just I don't want like I don't want to hate on this at all like I just want to paint this paint this in the proper picture because if they do do something they're going to have and that's exactly my point I they do oh my God are you 10 see nexar and Taz but that's my point with those three and by the way I don't think Nexa is going to be as bad as in Dallas because he has never been that bad he's never not even like all the time since he's joined G2 again he's never had as bad of a tournament as that so I do expect Nexa to be better than a hookie so I don't expect three hookies to be on this team all of a sudden like there were two in Dallas but Taz is gonna be worse than hookie that's that is that is a fair point you will be worth that's point I don't think that's debatable he will be worth hookie we haven't se hookie hook been in a wedding [ __ ] [ __ ] it I haven't knew what what are the odds we're going to change it live okay lower rating hookie or uhz yes oh my God this isting oh no no this is exciting let's do it we got to change it we got to change it yeah I'll just write the the thing full but um I have to give props to Striker for like the the amount of you're really giving this Runway really like think thinking this through this is like the depths of if if we have that 247 sports channels like the US has and it's on on every TV and every restaurant all the time just people talking about sport then you have to have like a 2hour conversation about G2 going into this yeah then this is kind of the the route we'd have to go but usually we don't because like realistically it's not going to happen you're like oh yeah don't even like try but you're like yeah this position uh Swap this around I'm really like I'm not making fun of you this is like I'm really I got it I got it you're impressed but the pro the point is I'm actually writing something about that so I'm already I've already thought this through I've already thought this through we're doing I'm doing like story lines for for Dallas so I've thought it I've thought enough of it through that I actually have a decent idea of how I think it will go I but I mean honestly but do you guys think there's any world where Nico actually picks up the op why not who cares the thing is like the thing is again if you want to take it seriously I'm just saying like if you actually want to take the event seriously if you want to take it seriously if any team loses to G2 considering the roster they have what the [ __ ] are they doing they should disend 100% I agree with you but I'm just saying like that's how that's how we have to paint it now because it is [ __ ] impossible it is impossible for them to win a series I could see them taking a map of VP because Nico goes [ __ ] crazy he he gets them so many openings that VP will just save 10 rounds in a row and they'll win a map off of it I absolutely 100% see that happening as a Poss as a theoretical possibility but all I can see right now is Striker dressed up like Stephen A Smith and he's been sent in a [ __ ] [ __ ] thing and he's standing he's doing the Mewtwo segment where it's meww versus LeBron James and it's Striker getting this and it's like well if Taz stands in for these guys against spirit and we're like are we actually considering is this a reality that I'm living in right now what we but you have to think about how exciting the narrative is if like Nico just goes and picks up the op just imagine he goes from normal rifler to what he's been doing the last two years two game leader wins the event two oper and does something whatever it is that they will do something you know I just think it's it's funny I just think it's an amazing story line it is an amazing storyline I'm not saying it will go anywhere I don't think it will be any successful I absolutely agree with two the two of you guys I just think it it's an interesting point to to converse on I just want to point out that I am on the record saying that win the whole event so you know I've got I've got you're also on the you're also on the record saying if if somebody loses them what the [ __ ] are they doing they should disband so I didn't say the disband po I will I will say it's just what the [ __ ] are they doing so that's what the [ __ ] are they doing yeah yeah okay let's bring the let's bring what are the odds let's I still haven't gotten my answer doesn't actually anybody actually think ni will pick up the op I think anybody will pick up the [ __ ] I think they I think they'll throw it around I think they'll throw it around for sure uh yeah I think I think Hunter will up a bit next Al I think Taz will not up I mean c side I think they will just throw it around but I'm just saying tside like the only reasonable way I see it is hookie they it depends on the maps they play they don't need it unless they're playing like a dust two or some [ __ ] right like you don't need it on all of the maps necessarily so yeah I'm excited I'm more excited if we get any vertigo anyway let's [ __ ] talk about what are these odds brought to you by One X bet okay last change let's go what are these [ __ ] gods what are the [ __ ] odds on this actually should have been Taz doesn't matter it's just going to be low odds I guess okay that hookie will have a lower rating than Taz or that Taz will have a higher rating than H yeah let's let's just leave it as it is right now but this is H will have a lower rating than Taz yes so over the entire event spring finals will he have I would say I give it 10% 10% 10% holy [ __ ] you have no faith in winning the whole event do you no but it doesn't even matter like if to be honest if they win the event hookie would probably he's supposed to play better than Tas I think the thing is the because of what I expect because I expect Taz will just play Massive bait he will throw guns around he will just do everything possible to be useful and it's not going to be through fragging you've got to shoot bro he will do so much of course he has to shoot but he will not have guns half of the time because he will throw them away that's what I expect to happen and he has more respect in himself and he will run in and he will run in first because he knows that's the best way that he will actually have some impact because there will be people track trading him stuff like that I just think he will do so much sacrificing that there's no [ __ ] way there's like such so little possibility that hookie will be worse than that um I'm Gonna Get Go Chad you go next I say 50% what the either will or he won't what was the last one by the way you guys what was the last one I was just like [ __ ] about asales they will win a win a trophy this year no but that one was fine well they haven't yet Dallas Stewie getting signed for a team oh yeah okay okay got it yeah I'm I'm gonna give it a good 15% 15 yeah I don't think it's going to happen I think you guys you guys are insane I think how like how do you think cuz anything's possible tazu hasn't played an official match against in like three years but that's why we're like trying to gauge how possible it is that that's is the point of this exercise there's a possibility of course they could just get slammed 130 130 and neither of them will do anything but Taz will just get tra I don't know some random some yeah some trades he will get some trades a cple pistol kills or something I don't know there'll be a few he's not going to get trades he's going to get traded traded deaths by Nico yeah and hookie is going to be like throwing flashes so it's not going to count for anything right do we want to ask the people at home what they think we got a oh we have to we got a result and it says 68% so it's like yeah 32% okay all right okay that's kind of high to be honest that's kind of similar to us right like overall yeah so it's bloody hell well well well people at home you've got a tough choice on your hands with this one is that does that all make sense has all worked out in the wash yeah yes he will have a lower rating no they he won't okay all right cool so uh yeah essentially this little segment which is called what are the odds brought to you by 1X bet you guys get to have a vote at home is it on Instagram or Twitter or both both both uh and then what you guys essentially vote for it creates a bit of a kitty and we're going to work out what we're going to with that at the end of the year but um you should explain what that word means because I have no idea oh ity is like a cat no well yeah but um I've never heard that expression in that way before so you have to explain it I understand what it means because I know what it means but uh that's a well that's a great question I I don't know why we use that let me I have to look at it now um but it's like a pool like it's uh whatever called yeah an amount of money that is made up of small amounts given by different people used by them for an greed purpose we all put $20 into the kitty to cover the cost of food okay I I've never had I've never yeah okay sorry yeah I watched um oh my God what did I what did I watch I went and watched uh the new Mad Max movie which was [ __ ] Terrible by the way nobody do not waste your time it's [ __ ] wul movie even with Ana till Joy and Chris hamsworth it's terrible I how is Chris Hemsworth as a villain that's what I want to know I I know what they did to his nose it was the whole movie was bad the first one was Banger yes this one was not good I would I would not recommend this one I I I didn't enjoy it but the thing I enjoyed most was the language that they were using and obviously almost all the actors cast in the movie Australian and they're using a lot of Australian slangs that was really good furiosa was amazing what what did you watch were you blind and drunk when you were watching it what the [ __ ] I mean it's supposed to be kind of a shitty movie where it's just like doesn't make sense it's just a lot of action the action was like we'd already seen it was worse than the original so yeah that's what I heard original meaning Fury Road or the pre the one even before that well Fury Road Fury Road is like the second third one I don't remember yeah fourth no there three three M Maxes like the original ones with there's no way there are people in chat who actually think that was a good movie it was putting me to [ __ ] sleep I would have there are people in chat who think that was a good movie what what is wrong with you guys you guys are [ __ ] insane anyway that's not what we're talking about we're talking about last spring finals uh okay so I guess we want to look at the event as a little bit more of a hole who do you guys have as your favorite it's pretty tough one actually yeah um obviously it's between the three Vitality Spirit phase yep um I want to start saying I think Vitality even though they lost I think they kind of got some Plus credit from me for for some reason I think the the Mesi uptick even though it was like it was crazy over performance like that Ace like [ __ ] like that's not going to happen consistently but I think it's a good sign from their weakest player so I think that's a that's a nice thing um overall yeah overall I think they have really good consistency so I think they're going to make a Deep Run definitely have a chance but I don't know if I can give it to them as favorites considering they really they didn't win anything yet on the other hand they did [ __ ] own spirit in a way um which is huge props I think that win is what gives me like um give me some hope for them and in Blast essentially yeah I think I'm kind of in that same boat in terms of I would put phase third in that conversation at this point just because of the tendency of the last couple of events EV the way that they've lost these elimination games that's really rough I do think that there's going to be some changes that are going to be hard to predict for us but just based on the trend at the moment I would put phase third in that conversation but I would put Spirit about vital and that's mainly for the reason that dong just disappeared in that Vitality series and I don't think that's going to happen for the second time and you know when you don't have your biggest star turning up against Vitality you are likely going to lose but he hasn't had so many disappearances for me to believe that that's just going to happen again or that vital has figured out some way to counter him I don't think that's that's necessarily the case people have been trying for a while and they didn't really find a consistent answer to dunk so I think it's just it was kind of an off event for him and that's kind of ridiculous to say considering he handed it on like 120 or something anyway um he had a bad series there that's um cost him a possibility of a win I don't think that's going to happen again I still think that the the map Pool not being settled is a big question mark there's been a lot of more time though but has it would you say that Vitality kind of I don't want to say that they like own dust two but I think they showed enough on Dust two in terms of proficiency and wanting to play it that they're like their map will make sense well the first time I saw them play Dust 2 they played it a lot of times in Dallas I think yeah look the problem is at the moment because there is certain tape on some teams and there's not on others and and it should seem like quite a simple map to understand you know okay well these are the protocols this is the basic way you play and there's so much more information available out there now in terms of all that the nades and stuff being uploaded by all these different websites all the time it's still these situations that these teams need to find themselves in and play through so if they're able to um if they're able to put themselves in a position where teams are uncomfortable like Spirit defending against mid to B splits right they had a tough time with that when they were playing dust if you're able to put uh Vitality in positions like that where they can't find a solution or they don't then then they could they could very well lose it it's just about our teams able to find that and what would those situations look like and then also this whole vertigo scenario our team's going to be I'm just trying to look at it right now in terms of the brackets that we have is anybody even going to be looking to to pick into vertigo I'm not too certain about that no na'vi no they're going to ban it right y FaZe will probably remove it I don't think that would even come into a conversation against uh against plays vertigo a lot even it's there that's why if you pH you're probably removing that you probably ban it first and then just risk a do two where so haven't been that great either yeah sure yeah so the that's the thing I'm trying to even work out how much vertigo will play into the equation which if vertigo is not playing into the equation then maybe dust two will um in certain matches so maybe astralis versus saw if both of those teams lose their opening games which I think is is the opposite of what we were expecting with na'vi versus Australis as that opening game um but if Australis play sore at any point then maybe you do see vertigo coming there verus Pro have been pretty Miss on vertigo in in recent history but it's still within their map Pool right they're a team who bans nuke we know that Vitality get rid of ancient so would it be something that verus Pro need to lean towards to try and unravel their most played map it's not that they've been very successful on it but it is but I feel like a lot of team were picking vertigo against them yeah um because they were were showing some weakness on that map I don't know where else you would want to take the V and you know that you've had Vitality for some time so you could prep for this well in advance uh if you're if you are VP so I I'm just that's that's the bigger conversation overall for me because the meta is going through a shift right now with the changes late within the season so we're in the runway now going into the next major um and there's even conversations that some people think there's going to be an up because Counterstrike has more [ __ ] birthdays than anybody I've ever known apparently it's got another anniversary of some variety coming up later this month I'm like what the [ __ ] mate this C and it's always different it's like oh it's 20 this year or it's 19 this year now it's 25 I'm like what the [ __ ] the what's the actual date that Counterstrike came out it depends on which version I guess yeah well that and that's another like there has to be one act we got to get it from valve we need like an official date of some or we could just celebrate it all the time why not maybe we should put it in the in the calendar you know of the yearly days that celebrate after you know straight after Kebab day can be Counter-Strike day yeah okay that's not bad at all yeah bring up one of those um but yeah I I don't know there's a lot of unanswered questions in that regard for me but I think going into this the teams which which I would say are in the wow it's hard to say Spirit are in the best form isn't it because they they did disappoint in in their matchup um they they felt like they they got blown out back by m in in B they're like ah this is our first tournament coming back blah blah blah okay we'll give you a pass there and then they came to Dallas great group stage destroyed phas uh but then got kind of destroyed by Vitality right so there's definitely a kind of question mark about their form and it it's a I think it's a huge event for all three of these teams like any of them could kind of make a claim I don't I don't think really vital can like be ah we're the best team of the season but they can definitely the season with Elevate their status uh significantly by winning because overall it's a pretty pretty I don't want to say stacked but it's a competitive tournament for sure like the the top end is pretty pretty competitive well I mean if it weren't for G2 having a standard it would have been two through to seven and a ninth best you know so it's just miles basically missing from the absolute Elite and from the title contenders so relatively well if we went if we went through all of these right for FaZe it would be a nice way to finish the year after disappointing last two events right because that's the it be a nice way to finish the year FR bu man sorry finish the season right but after all of those finals sorry after all the finals that they made and then having the the bit bit of drop off I think a finals birth again or a trophy for them here would mean a lot going into the next season worth of play um it would also help squash the the conversations that start with the pits out there about does FaZe need to change things and a good performance from robs would be handy with that na'vi this is a way for them to also kind of give the middle finger to everybody if they could get this Victory under their belt considering the field that you just discuss their Striker uh it would be I think for naavi at this point even getting a top four would be a good result I think for them at this at the moment because it's still like having a top four and be competitive in that semi-final I think that's already probably a win for them considering the last couple of events uh if it's not you know if they don't end up meeting like the the two bottom teams on the way or something like that you know if it doesn't end up being like you know they just beat sa and verus Pro and that that's it that's not particularly impressive but still like I could see I could see that being enough for at least them to understand okay we're not as bad as the last couple of events yeah okay so you don't you don't well I think I don't think that's realist like it's realistic for them to just shoot for the win at this point I think they're um they're going to be fine with you know good semi-final Mak the final yeah yeah okay I have a little exercise just for the in terms of the favorites so we all agree fa Spirit Vitality these are the three teams that should one of them should win the Front Runners yeah um I want each of us to like take 10 seconds and just think who do we think what's the gut feeling saying who's going to win and then I'll count down three to one and then we can say at the same time wait wait wait I'll gut feeling on who he think is going to win yes yep the event okay are you ready yep three two one Spirit okay okay why face I don't know you just asked me to go with my gut I did I I I just went with my G don't explain it don't explain it just Just Vibe with it but now if I think about it more if I actually think the bracket through then FaZe could play Spirit early in the bracket right because that's a good thing or a bad thing well I think it's a bad thing I think I think because I think if Vitality vers Spirit if we're going head-to-head from last time unless Spirit have fixed a lot to do with their dust to let's say that series even goes to three Maps but let's say vit Vitality win again they're going to get high seed in that group I think FaZe have a chance to get the top seed in their group which will put them on opposite sides of the bracket as Vitality but they could lose to Australia so could you never know but let's say that those two teams top either of their groups okay so then Spirit are probably going to come second in their group which is going to put them on the same side of the bracket as FaZe and I don't know who's going to come second in group doesn't really I mean FaZe in terms of if I was a betting man maybe FaZe is a better shot just because they have the easier group on paper to win at least obviously because on the other side you have vitar and spirit the other two favorites um so from that perspective they have a bigger chance to just go straight into the semi and from there you know having uh probably a favorable matchup in the semi and then only meeting the winner and the final you know like on of the other side so from that from that side I would probably go into that but that's just logical but I think I do think that they have a very good chance of not winning the group and I think there's too many too many downwards Trends there it's also Frozen who hasn't been looking as good at the as at the beginning robs hasn't been looking as good I mean throughout the entire year but and their last two events have just gone pretty horribly at the end I'm putting a lot of stock in that two hour conversation I do think I do believe that there are going to be better than the last couple events but I'm not sure I it's like this intangible thing that you can't really quantify I can't really put so much stock into that I just know I'm sure they will change something and something significant enough you know it's not just going to be some like whatever a couple of strats yeah okay well yeah I don't know you said go with the gut prop I want my gut I I I don't know why if I'm trying to find an answer it'll be very difficult for FaZe to win considering the things that they're up against and if they play Spirit at any point I think that that might be a mental hurdle which way yet to see them overcome in those type of games so how much how much stock are we putting into astralis I'm just curious about what people think I've kind of made my opinion but I think they are like semi-finals probably was the VP na'vi into they should be in the playoffs into phase and then possibly meeting vers Pro in the in the I think they can make a top the top four again yeah yeah I think that would be reasonable expectation yeah I mean they could also they could also if it ends up they yeah if it ends up that they're third in the group and like if they lose to to to na'vi and then go up against phas they could meet FaZe in the semis they've already shown that it's a pretty favorable matchup that's also a way for them to to get a little bit further yeah I I look I'm not going to Grand stand for them or anything I think that they're a team who's on the right path um and and a win here would be very important for a team like this but I I I think that they should be able to make another top four placing I think it would be a difficult top four place I think they're going to have to play some Counterstrike to get there but uh yeah I think they've show the thing is especially from their last uh game against vitar which was also very close in the semi-final like in um was pro league right um I think that from that it kind of shows that they have the peak to beat any of these teams they haven't met spirit so far I think at least or if they have I don't remember the them them meeting anywhere let me see if they actually played against each other I don't think so St spirit it's they played in the r the RMR are just the best of one that's all they lost the 1311 best of yeah different roster they haven't played in these rosters against each other but they've beaten FaZe on a couple of occasions they were in overtime on second map against vti that they nearly converted so it's they definitely have the peak to beat anybody here but they haven't shown it shown it no they haven't shown the peak yet I don't think no I mean like in single in individual matches like we can we know that they can beat any of these teams it's just they haven't shown it against cross and entire tournament yeah well okay yeah I don't know it's a good event I think it's a really good event to close out the season I'm going to be excited to is as playoffs in the arena from the Friday yeah yes okay cool I'm going to be excited to see that I I'm flying into London on the Friday uh has there been any announcements and stuff about this I mean we can uh do stuff now we we kind of mentioned some stuff um essentially the plan is we are doing a confirmed on Friday uh but it's not going to be open to to it's part of like a like a blast Afterparty kind of thing uh so it's going to be similar vibe to I say the pre-show for the for the award show that we did kind of people vibing in the background we're doing our own thing uh picking up some people you know players sitting down with us chatting um have some people already lined up we're not going to Le too much but you know some we're in the UK so you can you can guess some of that uh and uh if you have any ideas maybe hit us up uh so that's the idea for the Friday so we're going to do that from 9 900 p.m local which is 10: I think over here y in the central European uh area so maybe we do a bit of an overlap with the second best of three uh maybe not hopefully not hopefully it's a it's a quick one and uh so yeah you're coming over for that we're going to be there uh it's going to be a nice little show and then on Monday we're doing a a separate thing which you are not involved in but we're doing a a little little stream like a TV Awards launch show where we'll uh we'll say a lot of things uh we'll have a mid-season check-in with Striker and uh har prepared a bunch of stats so we can go through all of the awards and see like who is performing the best how things are shaping up for each category so far uh we'll also be announcing the location and date for the for the award show and and a very cool giveaway uh that we're doing together with WX um so people should tune in definitely let's say it's a like once in a lifetime opportunity that we'll be providing okay that's some exciting look out it's not lifechanging money let's just say that uh as some someone else has the the slogan U but it's a experience all right all right cool so Friday H TV confirm live at 10 European time and then on Monday something about the award show uh not the award show just H TV Awards yes yeah yeah not not award show just H TV Awards uh so yeah okay A bit of an action-packed weekend coming and it will be the close of the season so everybody uh the Counter-Strike kicks off on is it Wednesday yes yeah so The Counter Strike kicks off on Wednesday that's two days time uh today's Monday yeah that makes a lot of sense uh 1 p.m. we have a lot of uh interviews lined up for tomorrow we might even do like a little live post from media day just because we're going to have a lot of people coming in we have a couple of people there we have a lot of quotes we have some content shooting we might just do something a little small with it so it's actually going to be a fun day tomorrow uh hopefully a lot of interviews will go up as soon as we get them from something like I think noon to all the way to the evening we're actually going to have a lot of content going out so um yeah keep an eye out for that nice all right well we've gone a bit of a lengthier episode that's going to be my bad I think I tooko long in the beginning but hey look we're almost uh 3 hours deep in this one 2 hours 38 minutes and I think we'll shut it down anybody have anything else they want to say to the people at home I want to say that the Mongols are apparently number six on the valve ranking damn oh that's looking through the rest that's pretty much the biggest takeaway an IP 14 after that 21 are nip Mongols are just barely 11 but it's VP and complexity are like five points away or something it's very close between 9 to 11 Mongols could actually be a top 10 team by the end of one shipping yeah nice well good luck for Mongols that'll be sick yeah nip jumping back into the top 30 that's that's cool to see too all right cool well thanks everybody for tuning in uh we'll be back as we just said on Friday so you don't have to wait that long for an episode I guess we'll do one to wrap up the season uh after like the week after blast and then maybe these guys are going on holidays and have a couple weeks off or whatever and we'll keep if anything crazy happens um during the break and we're available maybe we do some impromptu if there's like wild Wild roster changes or anything happening I feel like uh we should do a show like after blast yep and then I had what if we do like a AMA show like we ask people to ask a [ __ ] ton of questions and then we just like record it and put it on you know somewhere during the break to have some more content going out what do you think about that that was an idea I had yeah we could do that I think it's just about getting some actual quality questions from people because people we should because they just ask questions like what do you think about this guy on this roster it's like maybe they can just ask about Mad Max furiosa and you can go on for like half an hour that would be I mean it could be stuff about roster changes what would be our like favorite roster move like roster move of this break or whatever yeah all right we'll see what we can get um okay uh Happy Birthday to random dude Q uh and star hunter recommending that titty Mo should
