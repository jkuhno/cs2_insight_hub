La no on the on the 21st boxer movement.com you can go there right now leave your email get a password and we have remade the store we're GNA have a lot of new stuff released so get that plug out of the way boxer movement. club and yes this is from the store be the best dressed movement player on hltv confirms chat okay is it still possible in CS2 to have good movement that's a great segue actually and I think I think I think it 90% is I would say it's 90% is okay so things are changing by the day like um for the better I don't know how much you actually want to jump into this or we might as well we'll go everywhere tonight okay I would say [ __ ] so we're already already we're already DED where we ending though they both made changes that have impressed me in the sense of like I think it it was stuff that they didn't totally understand but they still fixed it and then or they didn't understand like the value of it but they still changed it and then they've also accidentally reverted stuff you know similar to like how the you know the butterfly knife animation had got uh it was cancelable and now it's not and now it's back so stuff is getting broken and fixed throughout these last few months so I would say movement's like 90% a lot of the stuff that's remaining is actually like clip brushes and things on maps and sometimes we're seeing these updates that are like five maps have all like clip brushes removed and that actually will make a really big difference for uh how the game is going to feel compared to csgo but what what's your what's your feeling like what's your feeling feel it's closer I haven't had a chance to play a lot right like when I've been in all for the last couple of months I didn't have access to a PC I just have my laptop and I didn't want to play [ __ ] 70 to 80 ping anyway from Perth to Sydney service so I just thought [ __ ] it uh with all these updates happening I kind of just sat back and watched it all unfold and was just reading comments so I played a little bit today just running around some Deathmatch I'm going to play a little bit again tomorrow but after Christmas I'll spend a bit more time but all in all I I can't really give a fair critique at the moment of of the game I'd have to sit and wait and really uh put in some hours before I'd sit here and say one way or another so that's why you know I'm interested in the opinions I know Jason he's been having some good Runnings with cheaters over there in North America he's been having a great time I I read the comments on the forums and I kind of take them sometimes with a little bit of grain of salt sometimes a little bit seriously because more threads are popping up oh this is good or this is bad but it's the same thing like it's everyone has having different experiences out there I would love to hear more from the pros and how they're feeling because they just I know that they're busy just grinding the game and trying to you know make sure that they can perform at a top level but I would they're the ones who are playing it I guess in the best circumstances of land so maybe that's not even what most of us are experiencing right because most of us are playing at home on higher ping and maybe on some shittier rigs FL comp in csgo was got really good people didn't really appreciate it but like you could have you could viably play with a teammate who had there was a KZ player from Europe who played IM one season on ESA on like 100 ping and they won the whole season and he didn't even have that much comp experience and I just remember thinking like wow like 100 ping being viable in modern gaming is something that we take for granted for sure and in CS2 they definitely tested everything on landine and then shipped it and then have tried to fix the all mind stuff after the fact and I think that shows obviously but I I I'm sure you've asked every Pro what they thought and when I was asking about the blast World final I pretty much asked everybody most of them had I would say it was like if if it was a steam review I would say it was honestly overwhelmingly positive but okay again that's the land in the land environment in terms of how I remember we played we played like a little like um casual exhibition on land at proleague against like we did like the talent versus production staff versus like League Ops and and other team and the game feels I mean as everyone has already said and all the pros have said it feels like 10 times better on land than it does online but I know like when when it first came out playing with like 60 ping in na if you were on like the a bad server for you just felt like garbage and and it's gotten so much better since then so they've done they've done a really good job of improving that even even in csgo like most of the games I played in csgo were with like Europeans I was playing in like European matchmaking and that felt fine on like 100 110 115 p as launders was just saying and CS2 doesn't feel as good uh playing across across the ocean uh but it's it's again it's it's getting better like everything's in the in the right direction it feels in terms of getting fixed outside of potentially the the cheating issues yeah well you you don't conter playay a lot over with the Europeans or at least you did haven't seen you around well I haven't been around so much yeah you been around too much Conor's been gone too Conor was left for like a month so I've just I've been grinding na premiere on my own like solo not playing by yourself okay what's your rating uh I'm at like 21k 22k somewhere in there like 21500 round inactive and then play one game and then get back 30k I've heard I've heard that people have gotone inactive lose the rank and then like win one game and they get 8K ELO back and I'm just like what the [ __ ] that's messed up oh good for you guys I'm gonna have to test I've lost my rank but look that's yeah what's up Jason you good no I was just gonna say I my next Evolution I'm just gonna start playing face it I think I could make FPL and na I think if I that's that that might be a goal of mine for 2024 is is make FPL in na that's a nice goal you can play with steel you know he's he's making some comebacks as well I watch his stream all the time bro he's he's he's sweet I love steel all right cool well he's Canadian and uh you know you got to keep that in mind you before you're giving out too many compliments to people from uh from that part of the world Jason I know it's it's a tight Li thing with you guys all right we got to get into the show Let's uh we got some stuff to talk about tonight and now that I'm you know right in the runner show I'd like it if we could actually go through it so uh Dimitri roll the bumper let's get into the recent news [Music] all right we all prayed on the downfall of EG and thank God it finally happened that team not going to be around for too much longer they're selling their bloody blast spot and Cloud9 bought it they loved it they lapped it up and they paid uh from my reports a an interesting sum of money now for those people who may have missed it uh you [ __ ] in 2025 we won't have any more franchise partner leagues so I don't know why Cloud9 are spending so much money on something that they were normally you know getting through the showdowns for anyway um I guess it's two group stages and there is like some Revenue share splits I learned about but Prof you hear this news it comes across your desk why the [ __ ] is anybody buying a partner spot in a league that is only going to exist for one more year what was your initial thoughts well it all depends on how much they're paying right uh okay well I was told from and I can't I'm not going to say by whom but I had multiple people send me some messages and uh yeah and uh they told me they told me roughly uh $900,000 that's like that's like half of Nico's salary right yeah I think so well yeah yeah close close close no without the bonuses without the bonuses these were rep reputable people um who who who mentioned these kind of sums to me which was quite curious I didn't even message them they just reached out to me and told me uh how much how much it was so uh it it was interesting when I heard that figure for for for a year and essentially just like kind of two group stages which is what they would have been paying for there is like Revenue share that they get from blast that is very significant which covers I think more than 50% of that anyway so uh yeah it's interesting it's uh a little little context on that I know um one I read this Tommy wrote like a something on a substack I don't know if you guys saw it it probably didn't get like I don't think he even allows retweets anymore so it's just for like fun I guess but um this was like early December and in this article he says um these leagues pay partially performance-based Revenue share to each team with minimum guarantees reportedly in the $250 to $500,000 range top performers likely receiving upwards of twice as much um so this is this is for the eight teams that are in both blast and and eppl um but they've been receiving like across the year he says upwards of 750k in incremental revenue for being those partner team so just to give that some context that's kind of where the Rev Share value is in return for being part of both leagues I guess in theory if they're just part of blast you could maybe just to be conservative just half it I I don't actually know the numbers of what they pay out or anything like that but um this is from Tommy who who was a GM of of a top team and part of these conversations so um I would take that to be reasonably reasonably accurate you know you come last place in Bloss groups you get 540,000 that's pretty good I can do that yeah so you just need the 900,000 to get in need a small for there's more 50% covered there you could probably get it you have what a million followers on Twitter right you can just go to a bank and ask it's a dollar per follower right yeah I think that's that's how it works so I think it's pretty easy but no I think when when you add that in and then you add just the the fact that being in these group stages helps you like boost Rank and everything and it's not that bad it's not that bad it gives you some security on the team but um could have invested that in an actual oper which I a lot more or maybe both why not I don't know they're good without the oper boom just taking over name one good oper uh my mate my mate Joe is pretty good like honestly better than no opers I could probably just one of my mates just plug him in he would probably it would probably be better Joe Versus perfecto well depending on the map you get Joe Versus Perfecto for a spot yeah maybe Joe Versus Hobbit yeah see would be pretty good would be good no but realistically how how is this how is this real how is this real life are we gonna talk about Cloud9 like the team actually now we will or do we have I'll say to keep us on subject and to answer the question I'm not huge I think it's a little bit crazy to get a spot for just for just one year but I guess there are tangible benefits to being able to compete in blast and obviously if they win and do well and perform better than what they've seen I would imagine they at least come out equal in that exchange right like if they I don't know if they'll actually go on to win a team I don't know if you can expect it but if you go win like the the spring finals or the fall finals I mean across the year you you probably you Pro probably meet that point and like laer said there's the tangible benefits of increasing your position in the ranking getting different invites getting better seatings blah blah blah so I mean there there's other things to it but it feels like there's some more that has to go right to make this deal equal to value um but without knowing the numbers it's hard to be like Ultra critical on it you know like you know like I don't know I'm not a huge fan it it's crazy for one year if it was our last million dollars then it would be like okay maybe don't do that but like with these super orgs it's sort of they're operating on like a budget that sort of doesn't really make sense in the first place and like like they can tell people they're at blast if they win one tournament and almost break even then they get like then they win and if they yeah anything that raises their status is like worth extra I feel like then yeah if it was like an or Spirit or something who don't have as much money well also I mean I guess you you're probably feeling a little flush with cash as well considering you just sold shirro which I'm assuming was a pretty handsome chunk of change you know he got some extra cash from the buyout do we know any idea how much Shir I went for right I know that there was I don't know you're the one getting people messaging you with you have look can tell you one amount that it 100% wasn't 1 1,700,000 50 that's that's for sure not the amount that was I guarante come from I want to know where he got that from is he just going yeah just sitting there taking a [ __ ] go this seems like a good number a quick Google a quick Google there's a Tik Tok that says it was a little bit more than a million okay that's great just throwing that out there for you well Spirit W ti ti prize pool was three million dolls and spirit won this year so we know that he probably cost less than that and they' got you let's take the money from the DOTA team and put it into C oh for [ __ ] sake like it's not that Shiro is a great pickup for this roster right po I feel bad for Mr an Frost right just coming up from the academy and then he got uh someone I saw someone make a good uh a good comparison he got gored right the device that's that's a great comparison so I think you look at that and yeah sure what what do you meant to say um we can we can pivot into this now so yeah Spirit have been able to sign Mr shirou so that's not too shabby of a pickup going along alongside of donk and then you've got Chopper still in game leading Magic's there as the right-and man and then ztics uh is the fifth of the team with h still coaching so uh I don't know right I don't think anyone is going to sit there and say this is this is a downgrade right that that's not even in the conversation it's but my question right and and Prof this is what I want an answer to mate okay why did shirou leave Cloud9 or why did Cloud9 put shirou on the bench this is the one question I have not heard a single thing about honestly I've not heard anything I haven't heard like rumors more than I've heard speculations and it's just like whatever people can come up with it's like ah he played with naan and was good and then uh in electronic system he didn't have much like enough space that he want he couldn't really but just people like Giga speculating and that's all I can do as well like I haven't really heard anything which is impressive actually to to why this happened and I don't really understand it and really sucks for Cloud9 um at the same time I don't really understand why they don't feel any urgency to replace him in my opinion it's absolutely absolute Insanity I think Henry made like a good tweet when he retweeted like grooves quote that they're not looking for an oper and said like if I did this the world would be on fire like that is true like it's it's completely ridiculous that they're not doing anything and it's not like they there's no free free opers out there this art Frost Frost kid just got benched like just get him just get him on the team that's it it's so simple who do you replace hbert of course yeah oh okay I it's not even a conversation at this point right like you have to keep burmish now he's doing the in-game leading stuff electronic back in fine form on the rifle right axile we're still hoping for the days that he gets back some some level of consistency to what made him what he is I yeah I yeah the fact that Shir doesn't stick around and play with bomit at least a little bit man so sad it's so sad that's that's interesting right why why why is he that's that tells me that there's obviously issues with other players who are still on the roster then right like what if he I well no I don't know if that tells me that I don't know it just seems strange my speculation from the outside would be because it felt to me like towards the end of cloud we started getting a picture nathany had all those interviewers said were like he was he was the in-game leader in terms of calling but like he wasn't like a leadership figure within the team so it really felt to me towards the end of cloud line like after naphy left that the voices that had the most impact on how the team was going to play was shirou Groove and maybe Hobbit a little bit and I think if you're shirou and you have that kind of voice and you have that kind of authority within the team and then electronic comes in as an in-game leader and starts changing things and they bring boom in to be a new in-game leader all of a sudden if you're Shiro like your responsibility and your impact on how the team is playing starts to kind of fade away and I imagine that can be frustrating and especially when the results aren't going well you see it going into a direction that you don't agree with and you just feel like it's it's your time to move on within the team that's that's kind of that's kind of the outside speculation and angle that that I look at the situation with yeah yeah I think that that's not a okay so we're saying that there's voices that are coming in here which is crowded the way that he wants to do business right but is that that going to be different over there on Spirit like he's just going to go into that team and go all right guys we're playing my way I don't think that's going to be the case it maybe it's just the idea of a fresh start because there's a lot of baggage within that Ro and everything that's happened so U maybe wanting to move away a little bit from that is is good and then there was all the speculation about where he could go and there was people like oh yeah he can learn English he'll be fine put him on one of these International Teams well they just ended up you know with the with the Russian speaking team which I think is best for him um for sure overall so the biggest part of this all is just that you know at this point it is an honor to be able to say you could play with Don you know like Shiro can one day say I played with Don and that got to be worth something exactly how many majors are they gonna win together lers they're going to win like pending like natural disasters and help issues and pandemics pandemics two two majors I'm giving them two majors do as a you think this the rest of the lineup is is that impressive the I actually think zic is very good and K has lots of time to get better he's very young he also we cast him a ton in the academy League really like Sonic or ZK sorry both honestly and then uh Chopper Chopper I think Chopper is a very good igl but I don't think he's like I think he gets biged up a lot but don't think he's like a elite level I don't think okay exactly yeah that is true because now he has like proper player like well with Don and with shirou if he's still like getting I think getting biged up before was because he was working with pieces that weren't as good but now he's got some really good pieces so if he can't make it work with this then yeah I'm on board with you he does get biged up a lot right we we give Chopper a lot of price um but comes from that Vegas Academy should we do like an igl tier list though cuz like for me is he better than bomit no I don't think so I don't think he's a better player or caller than bomit okay okay yeah if you look at it historically probably hard to say that that that is true like obviously now this Cloud9 boom I'm not really judging much it feels very dysfunctional right now I think boom has actually done a really good job considering they're kind of too silly to think about getting it off like I meon can I play Devil's Advocate on that angle really quick oh here we go can I just play devil's advocate for a second if you're BR upid I'm not bringing up liquid and Nitro I'm not going in that direction don't don't put words in my mouth um if you four years ago Jason four years ago if you think about all the conversations that we've heard from the top oppers Pro opers everyone kind of saying the op has less of an impact op has less of an appointment the op is weakened why is there a benefit to in the short term for this first major being like we can't find an oper that we really want to bring in so let's operate without one and try and take advantage of this early stage in CS2 before the before they you know adjust and fix the game and tweak the game in the the power and strength of the op comebacks to where we want it is there is there value in them saying in the short term we're going to make the sacrifice of an oper and we're going to play the game as it is at this moment and then if the game kind of changes and oppers start having more of an impact that we like we'll come back into the market for an oper no because you just spent half your practice teaching everyone how to op on a different map so why why don't you just get an oper and then you replace the oper with a better op oper instead yeah I also don't really because mid-tier oper might not bring you value I would I would agree from a perspective of like if this is a team that's like you know a sprout or something you know that has to Moneyball the situation but they just like went all out to buy these [ __ ] na'vi players and then they're just like giving up essentially on this major that's coming up like the first CS2 major for me that doesn't make any sense but I think that's the difference I don't think they look at it as giving up on the major I think they're look it like they're delusional actually hold hold on hold on I I heard Mony tried to get the C9 or C9 tried to buy Mony already I'm pretty sure C9 tried to want to see I also heard they they approach Dexter as well but it didn't pan out but I don't know I don't know want to go to Greyhound so I hate their name that's a slow burn that's a slow burn they really need to do something with their names I'm just looking right so Z was the MVP at the World Finals and what 36% of his kills were the WP toi was the third highest rated player like 50% of his kills with the awp for the event 5 4.24% right this thing about the oring stuff I feel look it's maybe it's not overblown but I think oras are still going to be hugely impactful within the game of Counterstrike and I I don't see a way look maybe slightly right it's not as good or you know device given that interview a couple weeks ago like yeah we got to adapt to it and whatnot it's just going to be a learning curve for everybody right where we have a lot of different little uh issues that people are talking about every day with this game um I think I think it it intersects a couple of different things about the game that are being talked to like I don't know if you guys feel the same way but the game feels like it's a little bit more faster paced at the moment than what we had at the end of end of csgo I think potentially with mr12 teams are considering the economy and how many more rounds you have where you want to like kind of half bu or Force where you might not have the awp I think there's maybe a bunch of different factors into it that Cloud9 could be saying excuse me um there's reasons we don't need an oper at the moment oh we're Los him he I can't even get through the devil I am trying to make some [ __ ] up on the fly but am I making it sound at least decent yeah there it's not not that bad it's not that bad it's a decent angle but but I I I think it's not going to very well I think it's a risky philosophy to take but I think that's how we have to look at it not like these guys are [ __ ] morons like these guys are taking a risk and the philosophy of how they're building this team for this first major and let's see where they go after that no I don't think they are morons they just they're just making the wrong call and that's it I just want to be they just wasting time with it anyway right like if even if what you're saying is true Jason and they're going oh yeah we don't think it makes that much of a big deal okay so they they Potter along for the next couple of months and then after the major and then let's say it does like aers are still very impactful it's like okay well now we've all just wasted time trying to or can we actually get a [ __ ] orer in here like what are we doing you're playing positions that aren't going to be natural for a lot of these players right especially if you're having to supplement with the about overpass on your CT side right okay so someone now has to play a completely different role to nobody in that team has ever felt like an oper at all like what what what are we talking about like it's not any secondary or my hottest take about this is that boom Mitch actually looks like the most like apt oper compared to everyone else who when I sometimes see them like walking angles and stuff I'm like you're you're not like a you're not going to be able to do this forever like you just can't like you don't know all the angles like you're not like broi right now they walk get rifled down it's like I I feel like boom somehow is a person who that happens to the least but he's not like good enough to justify spending the five grand every round that's the good thing with like when you get to be a secondary oper or a hobby oper right is you're unpredictable people don't know what's coming they don't know what Peaks you're going for you know you get to do things a little bit more outside of the box but then once it becomes more refined and we're looking at high level Counterstrike where your you know heat map or your pathing and everything is being looked at you get [ __ ] wrecked like this is this a different game out there these opers are watching each other they're looking at the details they're looking at the Peaks light to go for and you're just some just you're just some guy like it's not even in your job like you're out it's like what's going on man so I I I don't think cloud are making the right call but uh we'll have to wait and see maybe Jason's right maybe J maybe Jason's bang on there was some people who were asking questions there someone was tweeting saying oh you know how good do you think this and and I I I apologize I'm a little bit tired so hopefully this isn't too nasty but I really hate the question that comes our way of you know oh how good do you think this team can be it's like well how long a [ __ ] piece of string right like at the moment in Counterstrike you were talking about a tier list launders regarding in-game leaders like a tier list in terms of even just the Counterstrike teams right now would be [ __ ] hard to do you've got Vitality number one you got FaZe at number two then outside of that you don't M doesn't have a fifth na'vi are they really the fourth best team in the world well hat TV rankings have them there VP are coming in at fifth right like G2 we still them one one [ __ ] Tournament of any salt with Nexa like what how are we meant to weigh any of this I actually I haven't looked at HL TVs right M Val almost two years now I would say like the last year of csgo which is this year like the first half G be like a full year and a half I haven't looked at the hltv rankings for anything because they haven't like mattered to me like you're saying like it was always like Loosely something between Vitality G2 and FaZe at different points in time being the clear number one team and then everything else not mattering at all yeah so I it hasn't mattered like every time I sit down to cast a game I always have an idea in my head I think this team is going to win for sure this is and I don't have that feeling anymore in almost any matchup yeah especially the world final the team that had been together the longest was na'vi D was wonderful they the longest standing roster at the world final is that crazy I think that is actually pretty outside of Vitality and FaZe right now that those are like tier one teams and vitality is obviously better but other than that like what the [ __ ] is going on and even if you look at like I don't know I I feel like what what also happened there's almost like a group of teams that's playing like tier one events and then a group of teams that's playing like tier 2 events so you have like VP Spirit Monty they are playing all of these tier two events they're playing against each other and then the other teams are playing against each other I don't even see the overlap properly and when it happens you see like Monty plays quite well you know complexity makes [ __ ] finals feel like in a very weird spot regarding that and that's why the major is again going to be pretty pretty exciting because everyone gets to play the same [ __ ] for once right than kit I guess to some degree as well yeah well citz obviously we're missing a team like liquid who were we're going to get to see play in the open [ __ ] qualifiers over there in North America which be crazy good luck yeah we'll talk especially with the with the online side of that but we'll talk more about that later but I I think a bit more to the point here is when you look at so now Falcons they take the core of n well now they jump up to number nine in those rankings right and they jump up quite high within the valve rankings as well and that's something which is fair enough right I understand how how this the the C I think it's good of them and and both are secure Calles that are getting them positioned in these top events but it's really hard right now to put your finger on who the top teams are so it is quite an interesting thought experiment to go Vitality phase and then who and then you have to actually like M who are they gonna get as a fifth were they happy with Brolin right were they happy with Brolin's performance there probably he fits the age he fits the bill anyway I don't want to get [ __ ] it I'm going to get too far off track and then we'll end up doing a seven hour show um let let's keep the the focus here let's uh let's jump into the next one now demit if you could bring out the Vox pop we did a poll uh regarding the changes within ANS so this is where we asked the people at home what they thought and wanted to know who got the best of the roster changes over there in the an Camp right so we've had players end up in a whole bunch of different places we had nerds head over to heroic we obviously had uh the core head over towards Falcons and uh then we had who who am I [ __ ] missing here uh oh obviously an pulling in nine and keeping deha and going polish with a Danish in-game leader so um this this is an interesting one as you look at this what do you think who do you think are the best out of uh out of this trade and you can look at it from many different angles I would just like to say that I filmed content with glaive on the first day of the blast World Finals and the golf yeah the golf thing exactly and I just asked him like how you doing like how's how's the new team everything like that and by his answers I know there was a quote from him saying that he didn't believe he wasn't sure if everyone would stay on the roster but from talking to him I don't think he truly believes that so I would just like to say on his half because I think he was being very professional in terms of all of the media that he's done since then or answering people's questions and like carrying himself professionally but I really think he had no clue that this was coming I I I really don't think so and uh I think and I remember like two days before we were like at go-karts and I saw glaive there watching um there was like a motorcycle race happening we're like yo you gonna go to go-karts he's like oh you can do go-karts here that's cool well I can't do that because I only have 48 hours to find teammates and I was just like holy [ __ ] like that's so real uh and I felt terrible for him so I just wanted to say that as someone who saw him because I don't think they had to get they had to get a lineup before the Rost roster locks I think right yes before the roster lock exactly so they got yeah I think he got really thrown into it um so I would say not ends but I think I think Falcons I think Falcons 100% Falcons are who's GNA disagree with Falcons fight me right now yeah it's Tod right right especially when they they get these spots because of having the core of the team you get Snappy who's being on the tip of the tongue in terms of ingame leader for this year uh you add mad and and Pi along side of Magis and then boros if he does have that potential that everybody's touting it seems quite exciting I think just think from the organizational standpoint that's probably the big win okay we secured a strong core of a strong team that's existed now you know is it just a a weaker version of an well time will tell I guess what are you looking at this you see mesin here you don't have deha in the team you don't have nerz in the team nerz is probably the biggest name missing from this how do you do you think it's an upgrade a downgrade like you think about it from the call perspective Snappy Madness and P it's an upgrade in the paycheck I'm sure but in the team overall what do you think oh I think it's I think it's a personally I think it's a downgrade of the team from what an was and what they'd been accomplishing um Magis I would take you know clear's clear's Deo but I think Miss missing nerts you missed huge a huge amount of production that nerz was able to provide um so I think it kind of got picked apart I agree Falcons is the clear winner and how this exchange actually panned out but um you know this is this is a big test for Sonic and a big test for um for snappy to make this team I think better into what an was because at the end of the day that's going to be what it's compared to and they just spent what like a year as like a top three team and probably go past that to last year um and coming out of coming out of the covid break and everything like that um pretty strong as well so I mean they they were they were high up in the rankings for a long time a lot of it's going to depend on how boros pans out if they eventually swap him out or if they kind of like the way he's developing as a player um but I think missing out on nerz is is is a really big piece of the puzzle that you're going to like to have had because Madden I think is a great great role player he's not he's not going to match any kind of production Magis isn't gonna have the same kind of you know aggression and assertiveness that nerds had despite the fact that he's got great skills so I think there's there's elements you're going to be missing that nerz brought if boros can't Step Up and develop as a player um so I think they win The Exchange in this in this little trade-off but I don't think this is as good as the actual an roster was before all these trades I boros is a bit of a mercenary when it comes to just playing the way he wants to play but I think like with zic at least there's a chance that he could be yeah shaped up really well like I feel like you have to listen on this team and snappy is a pretty auster igl like when you talk to him at events he doesn't laugh if a joke's not funny he doesn't take lightly when people talk badly but and like he's very serious about everything and I think that that he's going to run a run a tight ship that might be really good for boros but um I think I think the other thing this this trade did for Falcons too is it kind of gets past you know it changes the conversation from look at how they failed to build the super team with Nico and potentially with monesy coming over and it was a lot of disappointment and it it gets past that conversation too I mean that doesn't matter at all in game but from the outside you're like yep they failed to build that super team initially a little bit of like PR embarrassment but but this is this is a steal to be able to get these three players I mean they were so disruptive man Falcons were so disruptive and if if we didn't like I think this is one of the least kind of uh disruptive situations we could have ended up in in terms of top teams right this could have been G2 getting affected Vitality not finding a player like Mesi like ends obviously got completely gutted which is terrible for them but this actually the situation we're in right now is like Apex prove he's an major he Apex proves he's an amazing igl with Mesi and flamy coming in then we have G2 pretty much intact then we have um you know other people falling in a place and Falcons get a pretty good lineup like we almost got Falcons with like a pretty bad lineup and three teams completely you know ruined out of the end of the year I'll tell I'll tell you what else I think about these trades too I think of all the teams I think I think an's picking up the nine players is actually better off than heroic and the team that they're starting to put together I'm not a huge fan of this heroic lineup shape up I want to just touch on Falcons before we go there I think what you guys said about boros is like Sonic and snappy if he doesn't perform now he's never gonna perform like this is like and he has everyone was super excited about him at the major and then we kind of also got all of the all of the info from the interviews that he's kind of essentially like a pug star that that's kind of his approach right from what sdy with world no brain right yeah that that's kind of the can't get away with that with zic I guarantee that's not going to fly with these two guys so like if he if he has it he's going to improve and he's going to improve a lot uh because also on this team you have to look at it who's the star rifle it has to be him like it's not going to be modern and snappy you know and then Magis is he is a [ __ ] star in its own rights but if you move him out of what he's doing that doesn't really make sense because he's so [ __ ] good at it so I I think that's very important for this team could be kind of the make or break but at the same time they do get time they bought so much time with this which I think is the most important thing for them because this this lineup with Longs and and MHL was boot camping when they got the news like they they were set to play they and they played like a few games or a few days and then they got the call that this is coming through because no one knew what the [ __ ] was going to happen this was all they got cut from the team and we're like oh crap actually we need you back come to the boot camp and then they at the boot camp and you're like actually we see the [ __ ] out yeah someone check zic Steam friends list so they're but you have to give it to Falcons that they pulled it off because there was the r the report that came out about all of these players about I mean Madden nerds and sunpai going to heroic together but [ __ ] happened it didn't didn't come through and heroic in that situation would be [ __ ] sick because they have the core that is now an end three player core Plus shush and Tas or whatever combination they ended up ended up uh putting together it was they right the igl is gonna be announced tomorrow like Kon is rumored so that's a really good combination right of players that you have there so it managed to come through what did heroic do how they [ __ ] it up they everyone knew this was supposed to happen it was told I was told like 10 times that it's done you know that kind of a thing and uh obviously wasn't done saw n was like tweeting some stuff about you know it's not over until it's over or until the money is transferred so I guess there was some slowness from heroic side that Falcons hopped in and and got it signed because as you said laot launders like it wasn't at the beginning of the tournament that people knew what was going to happen it was like still in the air so it was kind of uh in the last few days that it got signed and then submitted right for all the spots so if really really crazy and this is just like the parts that we know like the story about the all of these transfers I feel like in a few years hopefully it comes out fully because it's it's insane well long already written one book so yeah yeah I heard that I heard the whole Saga was was actually a crazy crazy Affair like the the the two days would it it would be a very cool story to eventually see the public eye with all the back and forth and I mean I I think actually I mean I don't know does anyone have anything left to say on Falcons I was going to say like I think an actually turned out okay considering the situation they were they were put in they literally had [ __ ] no players yeah they had they had nothing and they and like like glaive said they had two days 48 hours before roster locks where they had to get a team and that's not bad what they've managed to scrape together no doubt what the the biggest thing for me again is they've just guaranteed thems the positions in these bigger events right like they they've made sure that they've kept the core together they was gonna gets a chance to try and compete at the major same as katav vitza it's an interesting risk to take in the sense that uh you've just got a new coach I guess the coach is Polish as well right so uh you got a new coach you've got the in-game leader is the only one in the team who's not polish so how the [ __ ] is that going to fly is is are they gonna is it the you know wolfin sheep's clothing are they going to work out that hey he's he's not one of them eventually at some point and they just get rid of glaive and glaive is just signed for this team or I I glaive can't C catch a [ __ ] break at the moment keny this is It's mental yeah he's he's certainly been put in a really tough spot but I would imagine when when this move is going through in your end and you have 48 hours and you and you have all your options out in front of you of where you can go what you can pivot how you can put teams together you put them in front of glaive and you make sure you have his Blessing on the route that you're about to take so I mean it's I guess he gets the chance to pick like the best of a horrible situation or the best of best of the bad things in front of them but I don't think I don't think this is all that terrible to be could been with no team right that you could have been left in a situation where you're not taking a core from a team you're picking and choosing one player from here a free agent here here buying someone out here you know and then all of a sudden you have this peacemeal team at least he gets a core of players that have played together and I guess I guess the next question would be because we always talk about this isn't like a true international roster so we haven't really brought up any kind of language barrier but with him being the only one who's not polish I know Hades and diha obviously speak English Hades has great English I'm not really sure about Goofy and Kyler but is there a language barrier that needs to be we need to be concerned about I think that' be fine I can right yeah I I think spoken to those guys before goofy doesn't really say a lot but I've spoken to Kyler a little bit before and he's he's he's actually the guy came up talking to me so uh I think they're going to be fine in terms I think you know everyone's saying that there's going to be a Polish theme in the future I don't think that's really going to happen I don't think an has any interest in making a Polish lineup I don't think there's a Polish ideal out there that makes sense like they unless you Chey that's what they said when an was finished that they were never going to be not finished Prof anything can happen no this is the inverse of that but okay thank you for Insight right here so I do think they're just going to go towards international roster uh when they need roster changes but the thing is like it's such a [ __ ] situation for glaive I think he really [ __ ] up by even going to ends I mean he knew he even said that he knew that there was a possibility that players don't stick around they're all gone yeah yeah that's a little bit different but the thing is let's be real these rumors were there I knew these rumor if he didn't know these rumors what the [ __ ] is his agent doing and he's a player as well right they're always much more connected to the [ __ ] than we are I'm pretty sure he knew it like he was either like too optimistic or misinformed it's one of these two things and because you go into that team you have no chance to do anything these players are going to leave regardless like you can't [ __ ] what is he gonna [ __ ] win the tournament he's not going to win a tournament it's like people that are looking for a new team they're not there to win the tournament they're not practicing with you like getting in your [ __ ] ideas that you don't even [ __ ] they're not even great probably because you haven't been playing CS for a while and even when you were playing you weren't that great so it's like how how is this how is this fairy tale gonna work it was never going to work so instead of going to heroic where he actually could have maybe had a theme in in some ways um that is Danish and build a d like it kind of would have made sense well imagine him at heroic with shush and now we St building a team T and then you had Nikos who they now got right now they have Danish [ __ ] lineup you have debris or something that kind of makes sense I'm not saying it's a world beater but but at least the lineup that makes sense and he has a chance to build something now he got like inserted into nine practically like how how is this going to work is he gonna be able to now tell everyone how to play CS also yeah I mean I know heroic in a bad way right now but it also assumes that he had the option to just like pick heroic at the I'm pretty sure turned down heroic yeah I was going to say there must have been a conversation with heroic right cuz they would have wanted to stay Danish for at least the I'm assuming they would have wanted to stay now they have to go International but now they have three Dan and an Israeli it's like what the [ __ ] going on over there like the nicod do signing If You're Gonna Go International and you're heroic why are you getting nicod do name an opers name a good oper I mean ncod has Joy here is pretty good n has been really good in CS2 in in PRI right yeah yeah but what are they playing Danish they're Danish JW Danish they were doing well like they were they were on my radar for a bit I was looking at the results they were getting and since Roy had joined they were doing really well right Roy had got left from fnatic and went to them and they were winning a lot of of M of matches and they're playing against like the B booms the world the forses those type of guys so I mean people are saying there's not that many crazy opers for international lineup because like people are saying Dexter Dexter is not going to join he left OG for a reason art Frost he's just going to go to a Russian team Russian speaking team zorty is not going to join he's just joined b boom you know regali okay CL is right there's not a whole lot of operas to go for we just we're back to the start there there there are if you're Russians speaking then there are yeah that's true no he's right that from their from their region they just have a lot of them right it just depends you want to put up with like The Dore pression kids like [ __ ] Deco and staffle do you actually you know that that's they they pick of the litter over there someone's just said seriously in the chat simple poison free agent right now yeah maybe nicod I take it back nicod is a great pick up but now you might as well just go [ __ ] Danish so we're just stuck in this yeah it's just stupid it just doesn't make sense nothing makes sense and I think that's why if we go back to the to the poll that we had definitely the the the correct answer is we all lost this this transfer period we all lost there's so I didn't even know that was an option i' change my answer to that yeah it it was it's such a shitty transfer period like every every team is just like a random I don't even know it's almost like reminiscent of like the rosters remember like the beginning of of the I disagree with this I disagree with getting this getting this liquid with Kaden I think makes up for Heroic entirely as long as kadian still playing I think that's great how many other good changes were there right like I guess Vitality vity Frozen V Frozen phas and if you think about it Mesi to Vitality means that uh Magic's mag Magis [ __ ] can still make another team good right he can be on and vitality is still great so I think that actually I've casted him for six year six seven years I still magic magisk try try casting with Anders when he just throws his name out in Danish like every other time yeah holy [ __ ] but isn't that true I mean like at least like liquid was worse off liquid's better off now Vitality are just as good that's really good then you have Falcons who actually managed to be good without ruining Vitality at the same time so that's good too so it's not that bad at all I think I think the bummer the bummer about it is it feels like I mean we just kind of listed off like liquid looks cool Falcons kind of wins out here and then the other changes that have been kind of cool yeah it's it's it's vitality and phase so it's like the top has had the top teams have had some cool ones but you still you know I think roster changes sequences in this in the scene are always better when you get like the number nine and 10 team that's able to jump up like three spots and actually start competing with the top baby we just have to find out yeah Spirit Sho with spirit is is really cool obviously as well we'll see if they can compete with the top but you want to see that more competitive nature but the problem is too like the longer these changes come in like the more changes that are happening because it feels like we're getting we've gotten so many it's like those teams have like a ramp up period so like we're not actually going to get the answer to this until the major which is what everyone's eyeballs are set on but that's that's the best part about all of this right is all and again we get back to like this conversation about what's the status quo Counterstrike right now where you going to place all these teams well we're going to work that out very very shortly because of the major and I'm hoping that there are some of these names that are just like chomping along at these online tournaments who are doing a good job or we do get you know Spirit making an actual Dent with the big names they have there but they're the they're a team on the periphery like I would love for the Mongols to actually come in and just [ __ ] and and actually you know make a top eight run that' be sick because this is a good time for everything to get shaken up a little bit with with this regard because even though we know these household names and they're playing in these partner leagues and we're seeing them from week to week you made a good point before we were talking about some of the teams who are only playing in like the ESL Challenger events playing against other teams who are only playing in the ESL Challenger events and the top teams is the top quote unquote of playing against each other we don't actually have a good test right now to know who is the best teams in the world other than vitality and phas outside of that it's all just I would say Up For Debate um and and even when you look at a team like ma who have been shown some good form they don't even have a [ __ ] Fifth and that's going to definitely play a big factor on what that as a roster is going to look like as well so there was just some more roster news that came out lers and Jason maybe the two of you can get excited about this George schnortz and Junior depart EG ahead of reported move to nouns and nouns would be uh Carson CJ Mary Jor and George how does that sound anyone getting excited about that yeah I think that's really good I mean I think I think uh junior was it was a like Junior will be on sort of the next up na team and I think now's had has a good foundation for that um and nouns are they I mean a lot of these na teams are just I don't know I I think it's great they stay na for the time being but everyone just has to get better because like yeah obviously otherwise only we me and Jason are GNA be the only ones talking about that I know it's exciting within like the context of the na scene like this get excited about it get excited you're I'm not I'm not that I'm not that excited about it I think it's like a pretty it's a good move but yeah it's not like I was more excited about NRG coming back in and stay and staying within I was I wasn't excited about that at all I wasn't excited about that at all what would you have done the lineup or the the lineup the or coming back is great the lineup that they put together is not good what would you have done with the lineup if you couldn't go outside of Na or do you think about it if you stay in na yeah if you stay in na uh I'd have to I mean I don't think it's this is the lineup the lineup is dabs Breezy OC Fang and hex yeah that was actually hard for me I was like I understand not liking this team on its face necessarily but like I like that they're in na if you stay in na how do you get better players I think they needed like a different entry Fragger maybe like anyone from maybe freezoid M80 like swisser for example swisser swisser if you could take players from other teams that I would have been waned to get swisser that would have been someone I think I think Ms Ms was a big grab for for M8 I like M excellent player yeah um I I don't know to be honest I don't know what they had available to them but I'm just like looking at it right out of the gate I know when they were putting that together I was hearing the reported like I don't I don't want daps playing um I know he still thinks he can he can make it happen I would I would just have stuck with with him as a coach if I were him I think Breeze is like one of those wrists where it's like all right Breeze like you better show me something you've got like three three to four to five months to like show me him that long damn dude he was number one in na on premere in the in the game okay I mean that's that's just what it like because like his his disappearance from like during the online era I don't know what happened he I haven't seen a player drop off that hard since like snacks like snacks was like amazing and then just like disappeared and Breeze did the same thing during the online era so I don't know it's it's hard in in North America but this team this just typing on online interest think Moses how how it turns how it changes when it's an yeah you were tweeting just the other week who am I hyping up online Bree no I said he disappeared during the online era I'm not hyping him up I he just he just went missing off the map so if he doesn't show anything quickly it's like okay time to move on and start building up some some different talent that literally means he's a good player like that's literally the only evidence we have well online yeah disappear if you disappear during the online period that just means you can't play against noobs so well he had his chance when we came back and it's it was it was it was ugly it was not fun to watch fun it really fun it yeah okay all right all right all right yeah what's up no I just I don't know like again like these na changes are like cool within like the the context of Na only events but none of them are none of them are capable of competing against the European teams even the tier like the top na competition at the moment outside of like your liquids outside of you know complexity um is basically like tier three of Europe yeah well maybe that's and it's gonna be that way for a while it's gonna it's gonna be a long road back but Australia is like tier five of Europe so you know at least you you got to R up on us there it's true we can we can if we put it in context it does feel a lot better yeah right so one in one year steel can join NRG and DBS can coach how but no Ste said he doesn't want to play professionally he made like a tweet the other day saying he wants to do like desk work and stuff yeah yeah he did um and how old is he he should have to do no [ __ ] that he does 10 years of being banned then he has to do three years of mandatory igl service to na then he can retire if he wants to this year man on the 28th of December he's 34 he's my age he has great skin that poor guy coaches got unbanned before he got unbanned oh my God yeah yeah it's been sideline for so long it's [ __ ] insane isn't it I mean but like also like Joel didn't even get banned he just got like slap on the wrist slap on the wrist yeah I honestly I wish I mean I'm never gonna blame him because I think in some regards especially when you're when he's 34 and he's been out of it like that route of going content creation and streaming and FPL and making videos and trying to do desk work is probably a little bit more reliable in terms of a career in terms of money than like rolling the dice on and competing with an NA team but I think steel would would be someone who would make a really really cool option for a coach if any of the na teams wanted to go that route you don't want daps in the server but you want Steel in the server I would take steel over daps in a heartbeat he is four years older than daps I would take steel over daps in a heartbeat okay four years SM say one more time for the back you want to go over it again no no I'm just I'm just I'm just making just pointing out a couple facts I know it sounds like I'm kind of like [ __ ] on daps and I guess I am in a way but I I actually really like daps I just don't think in This Server I don't think it's G to it's going to do nearly as much as him as a coach I can help you out as well like I've seen DBS at events for like six seven years he's been talking about retiring he want to go more into the business side of things for like so long and then just kept getting pulled back to be an IG because they needed somebody but I think he's always been sort of flirting with the idea of not playing anymore like just doing something in the in the background to help teams or whatever and I think also they probably tried to offer automatic and then didn't get him so that might be a reason why they have dabs right yeah I heard they were going for him and and he kind of mentioned the same thing didn't he he was like I'm going to wait and review my options after January or something like that I mean automatic would be a good player to get if his if his heart is still in it obviously and automatic someone who you almost feel like of everyone in na is like you deserve to be on a competitive team because everyone likes automatic he's super smart player super strong and he's just kind of out in the winds all right you guys done about North America you got anything else you want to say about your brought this upon us but I did I did yeah no but I wanted to see you're steering the ship I wanted to see where we ended up I wanted to see what happened it's all right it was good I'm glad to hear a little about North American Counterstrike you know we got to do it sometimes all right uh let's uh move our attention here we can go from the recent news to what is just more recent news but under a different headline uh so the last events of 2023 have come to a close at least the big ones not these online events that are going to be going on for couple weeks longer as people don't have [ __ ] Christmas apparently uh but uh look we did have ESO Challenger going on over there in Atlanta and uh VP were able to scoop that one up with Fame I believe it was being the MVP uh that was a grand final against Apex that was over in the blink of an eye so uh that was quite a quick one now I guess we went from North American to North American Jason how far away are you from Atlanta uh I a twoh hour flight okay so not close at all so you weren't thinking of making your way down there you did go to the fragadelphia I went to fragadelphia in Chicago that was a two-hour Drive Atlanta's a little bit more of a hike okay uh and what do you what do you know about Atlanta uh hot it's it's it's wonderful it's hot it's got a lot of traffic it got a cool night life though um well it's got a lot of strip clubs and it's got a big gay population so okay take from that what you will all right at least half of those things are great yeah we learn we learned about we learned a bit about Atlanta with Jason so that's nice but there's a restaurant we used to go to uh during e League that had a big uh wooden carved [ __ ] right at the bar just yeah okay all right how how big Jason if you had to use your hands to show us how big was the [ __ ] TR not to get splinters okay so it wasn't that it's like a it's like a healthy half torso it's a half torso okay A a half torso or a full torso well an upper torso a half torso oh I'm trying to Envision like is it down the center like what do we where how we split anyway I'm not sure that matters Jame okay let's cut to the chase Jame joins Cloud n all their problems are solved oh but then okay but then you can replace boage and Hobbit and then you add donk oh then you add Don just add any VP right any you could add fls yeah both are good both are pretty good I think that's was [ __ ] sick in in that [ __ ] true to yeah turn turn talking about Cox the the event with a with the chck allom yeah was it D Dasha I don't know bom Dasa yeah that's the one you've got that imprinted on your he's he's still under contract to mention it every seven minutes dude okay look look look okay dude first of all we don't know obviously okay for all of us who have been doing events for a long time we've done like Star ladders like all these events where we've had to do ad reads mid game and stuff or desks whatever it is so when I saw this originally I was like okay this is kind of just like Nostalgia almost like wow this is fun we'll we'll make it funny like we'll make it funny and then it was like map five of the grand finals in overtime and Don got a 4K and scrawny had to go and uh b boom DOD like we were just like God damn it like listen we show up to cast and at the terment organizers they get to pick if they sold sponsors and we have to do ad reads that's part of the job we you never want it to be that bad but it's not like we can argue against money that they've already made by selling the ads right like we're just there to read them so we didn't want we kind of they came up one of them to be fair to them uh fizer who are doing production they sort of came from DOTA and this like their first csgo event and they one of the guys came up to him and he's like is this weird like everybody on um the forums are saying like this is uncomfortable to like listen to these ad reads during the game and I was like yeah it's it's like we've never had that for like many years and there's no current organizers that made you read ads in the middle of game so you probably shouldn't do that you should do it like before the game halftime and then at the end but there's no break in the middle of these games so we gave him the advice to change it for the future and told them that this is something we that people have done a long time ago people aren't used to that now and so I think they got the message but yeah they already sold the ads they already made the agreements and they probably shouldn't have made them the way they did so it is what it is um that had analy could have taken some of that burden off of you guys as well too I think it was their first experience with English Talent is what I understood so they just just started with this and then the desk is maybe future I want to know who got to keep the shirt you or Henry well I looked better in everything that Henry wor he was upset with the the clothing I thought it was pretty cool to at least it was very nice creatively to be at that event because apart from some of the logistical and Technical errors being on a set you know like we have sumits and other things having a stylist as well as having the set designers would come in and change the props every day like day three they added a literal fireplace to you know just the English casting room so they really did do there were people there that were creatively doing a really great job to make things feel interesting and fun in the building so that part was great we'll say that yeah definitely uh so some some teething room in other regards there but we were talking about VP who Prof brought us here to by talking about norbert's performance in that event I don't know how many people ended up watching that event because of some of the things I know some people on Reddit were having a hard time with that but regardless we're talking about [ __ ] ESO Challenger Atlanta and I've followed Daran on Instagram and just every [ __ ] three days it's like daran's in a new country I'm like what the [ __ ] VP always seem like they're somewhere new doing something crazy so um I think this type of a win for them they're at fifth in the hro TV world rankings right now I don't really know how to measure them properly against a lot of other teams we know this is a team that is always going to be difficult to put away they're always very annoying to play thir rankings okay so yeah yeah Nero put out that I think like 10th in es yep which I found kind of funny because uh Nixon tweeted something about like VP going to ESL Challenger events and like building their ranking while like ESL values it the least out of all of the rankings kind of ironic yeah well the the this is this is the thing we have right now a bit of a disparity within those rankings right across the board I guess the only one I I wonder if it's going to the only one that's really good is htvs I'm curious next topic shocking but yours only gets players bonuses so like whereas you know the valve one gets them into to different positions at the major and the esl1 I wonder if the esl1 still going to have any value come 2025 I mean the big disparity is spirit Spirit is sixth in valves rankings 13 on hltv and 20th on ESL yeah that's interesting Jason what's going on with your webcam you cool looks perfectly fine what did happen look like a work of art that's kind of cool we see that rectifies itself yeah let's see all right so I just wanted to have that as a little little topit we've covered that off I think just to say I think going into it I was I was I had some higher hopes from like Monty and complexity complexity for me was hon those are the two teams as I said before and together with VP that are like just need bigger guys man they just have too many small guys yeah like card's their biggest guy but he's still like pretty short I think they just don't have any big guys no big presence there in there I think it's really holding them back they just are too small what we talking about physically yeah physically I mean they need to hit the gym they're lacking they lack pres they lack presence I think Al Al Le brought he's like a firecracker like he brought some energy to like when they lose obviously it's probably gonna be hell if Al is beside you he's gonna tell you why they lost but then you're going to get better and then you're actually going to win more but now they're just missing like just like a sizable man to be on this team when they walk around events to have more presence to likeis exactly a sis like Taz as a coach of G2 or like you know another one of the VP members to come over to just be with them while they're walking around I think it matters so we need a toll because nothing else will fix complexity they got James got they got the biggest upgrade ever they do have James IRL yeah but you don't see him all the time you don't see yeah we should see him more yeah that that would solve the problem I look complexity are the ones who disappointed me the most of this they lost to to Mongols three times um which look I I no I don't want to I don't want to knock the Mongols because I think that they're a good team I don't know where they keep finding these new players from [ __ ] senzu being now in I think well yeah at a l Cafe I'm sure they just rolled in and went who the [ __ ] wants to come on an international trip right regardless they they they're playing good Counter Strike still but the thing is and I and again I don't want to detract from their performance I just want to talk about the slide from complexity you're in the first series Tour event in Sydney you're looking like you're playing some good CS against FaZe and now towards the tail end of the year you've had some absolute stink as a result and it's just completely put your position in World Counterstrike and Jeopardy if they had a strong event here they were able to make it to the semi-finals the Grand Final have a have a strongl looking team okay cool we go into the next year and go complexity or a team that we have to actually keep on our you know watch card but now I don't give a [ __ ] M you you you bought you really just [ __ ] up the tail end of the year so with this status qu Counterstrike being all over the place complexity aren't one to watch me anymore it's like well maybe but they've shown shown some bad stuff I I I don't look at it as harshly I they's still a team to watch but I think it it really hurts like the image of starting to build them up as like someone who can challenge for a trophy in like a champ cont anymore they go from being a contender to a really just like a dangerous team that you have to get through who can who can upset who can make a kind of slight playoff run but it takes away that that feeling of them being able to actually challenge for for a tournament Victory I'll tell you what though I mean it's G to stay that way if grim and floppy can't figure out how to remain consistent in terms of being you know the second or third second and third player on this team or you know second and fourth like one of those guys needs to get consistent and being right up there with a Le and they need to be able to have that because I mean when you're looking at the performances even in some of those losses that JT was locking at this event if you have JT as an in-game leader kind of fragging and Performing the way he did at the event um and having some of the maps that he did and you're and you're not able to do anything at the event like that's that's rough because JT put some [ __ ] work in as igl I wonder what the the falloff is put down to though because of it's all lack of motivation end of the year that's not the type of team that can have that excuse like that's not the type of team they can tell their foot off the gas I remember this quote a long time ago from heo and he was talking about like na players versus EU players and he just said like it's not just that EU teams have better teamwork but EU individuals make better decisions and I thought that at first that hurt because that's something that you can't really fix just by like you know fing fixing things as a team you just got to be a smarter per you got to go back to the beginning of your life and like get a better education or something that's like impossible to overcome but then I thought no this probably probably something to that like individuals also making better decisions I do think that like on the low end of this team like Jason's saying there is some inconsistency when it just comes to even decision making let's let's be real though too like the some of the games they lost against Mongols like they played they played they played like horrible counter- strike but it wasn't like an indictment of their overall game plan they played some s like they got I think they got ninja diffused twice um I think they lost like a like a fouron to e like Eco round in the SEC in the series against Mongols they lost like three of those rounds that are literally impossible to lose unless you're an at a team or G2 or or G2 just wanted to say want you guys do things that we could never imagine and they they had literally three of them in one map um so I mean I think it was like it it seemed like one of those like they were off their game mentally and not as as [ __ ] focused which isn't an excuse It's just like you know I think if they play I don't know it's kind of hard to say that too I was gonna say if they play Mongols again but they did play them twice at this event they lost all three match best of one and best of three yeah I think it was It was obviously a very very bad rough weekend that that is uh that they're not going to be pleased about but I mean look if you wanna if you want to be a glass half full kind of guy which everyone in the world knows I am um I say this is one of those opportunities where aliz really gets to show his value in terms of leadership because his value in stepping into this team as a leader and getting them to this point is huge and I think how he reacts and how he helps this team bounce back after a devastating loss is going to be just as important as kind of the attitude he brought into the team when he first joined and this is where Al Le has to overcome some of the historical aspects of him as a player within liquid where um his attitude has sometimes been to their detriment and he can't afford to be that he has to be like the guiding principle of the team now with that experience that he has and with the trophies that he has and the stature that he has as a player this is one of those things where if you can find a way to get team to rebound as a Le you you gain so much more respect from the team and from the players and and this team can can kind of bounce back and get started in 24 on the right foot yeah I'll say this yeah I'll say this too I because I love this I'm like a I'm like a grander scale of the overall scene I [ __ ] I [ __ ] love watching teams like the Mongols come in and just beat the crap out of any teams I I absolutely love it because you sit there on year Ona and and look I I do it too from time to time just because I look around at the scene and what the scene used to be five six years ago and what we're missing now and it's like you know we we want some more we need more events we need to have like a proper circuit in na we need these teams to be more active at tournaments ESL and blast have taken all the events away that they did in na like we need those back but then Mongols comes in and like you said Chad they've made like plenty of roster changes and found Diamonds in the Rough they're in [ __ ] Mongolia and coming in and having better improvement over time and finding better replacements for individual players than we've seen na do since like 2017 like what's going on opportunity means more to them though like that's that's the thing right and I know that shouldn't be the excuse but it really does like the opportunity to those guys means a whole lot more to them just from where they're from right the fact they get to go and see the world it's it's literally life-changing money for them and I've seen it first hand by losing to them back in the [ __ ] day man I saw what 30 grand after an RMR win well it was a minor win back then did to them but I think that's it like there the hunger for it and that that's something which you as an individual especially if you're competing in an elite level team need to be able to keep up yourself and as like wanky as that feels like we're all you know all this this mental health [ __ ] or you know F this stuff is real like especially when everything is just a [ __ ] mindset like if you're a professional player at the top end of Counterstrike and you want to make sure that you can compete at the top end you need to have the mindset to be able to do it you can't just [ __ ] Coast you can't just take your paychecks like you need to actually be able to compete or you're not going to be there for too much longer so I would say yeah I would say though that like the higher paid players in North America are worth it like most for the most part they're actually like really good players like Naf twist Al and that on the lower tier though I think like you know these some of these guys in na are really are playing for the opportunity to be able to do this fulltime I I think that one thing for sure is that other regions maybe more so but I don't think that that's actually the main reason for na for you know why they haven't improved or like why they can't well I I think that like some regions definitely have better igls like Denmark for example like probably three of the best igls currently right now just that's not a coincidence right I think in na we don't have that sort of culture of creating great leaders I think most of them have been like Canadian somehow or like you know once in a while you get a good one and then you think about Blitz as an example from the Mongols they've got like a pretty they've got a gem with him like he is a he's like a legit chess player like he's got a a legit Fay rating he's a Fed Master 2000 Blitz 2000 over theboard um like in every sort of every category and I feel like that translates probably really well to Counterstrike just enough experience on top of and then you know he can kind of be like a Jame like he could take players who don't know a lot maybe he's a good teacher and make good players but do we have any igls that even are comparable to Blitz or any teams in na that are coming up that like I guess Walo on EG as an example of being close to that but uh not that many not that many igls we can compare to him I think yeah I D came back to NRG there's no igl's that I mean the the other problem is too like I mean there's the N has that severe problem where we have just enough veterans who don't want to like drop down and train up new talent and develop new talent but like you still want the veterans in the team so like there's there's not really yeah I don't know let's not got back into the na Quagmire it's it's a whole chicken able to solve this one have we but I I do want to quickly just segue and then we'll get into some ads here because I think talking about Mongols is important and we are going to have like the armr discussion a little bit later on but I there's a whole discourse going on at the moment about Oceania only getting one spot for the Asian armi and and Mr Messi alsoo gr pit with the double thumbs up he explained that sub region slots in arar are distributed evenly if they cannot be fully distributed equally they're given to Regions within single highest world ranking teams uh So that obviously doesn't make a lot of sense unless you know what I'm talking about you guys can find it on Twitter but essentially because of the way it was in the valve rankings like the oce the oceanic teams were towards like I think like fourth or fifth or something like that like further down so they only ended up getting one spot um where I wanted to go with this is if Greyhound are the team to get that spot which you would assume so now they've add a DEX to the roster um it's still going to be [ __ ] hard for them to get one of the two major spots required because you'd think if Lyn Vision get through if Tyler get through and the Mongols get through that's [ __ ] difficult like those three teams in the last six months have had some decent notoriety to their names with different results so I'm I'm uh I just wanted to bring this one up just said it's going to be quite difficult for um the Aussie boys to make the major I think it's going to be a tough one I think it's going to be a real hard one I'm real racist these days like I want everyone to have a national team I want all to be represented at the major if possible I want more opportunities you're a nationalist it's a better sounding word I'm just gonna just help you out there instantly demonetized don't even don't even try what Jason save the day there yeah I do my best that's what I want I want everyone in every country to be amazing [Laughter] yeah I'm a real fascist is uh what what happens Chad what if we get uh is this is this time for jks to just be like you know what I'm coming back to the boys for One Last Ride let's get them to let's get to the major I've tried I tried already I think I think he's got other aspirations at the moment but hopefully we can get there we'll try if grahan don't make it to the major next year then maybe we can make it happen we'll see we'll see let's let's go to an AB break and we'll come right back and we'll uh get into talking about the blast World Finals [Music] best

sponsors Mak this possible let's keep this show on the road all right I wanted to jump into talking about the uh blast World Finals that was uh the Big Boy event that we just had going on over there in the Abu dhabs I think that's how they're saying it on the streets uh Mohan you were there you were doing the business you were getting it done the rest of us were wait Prof were you there or were you I was there oh [ __ ] you okay yeah but launders was casting you were you were you were not you were just you were just there I was just there I was I was just wanted you know but it how how we have classes yeah what on we have what do you even do at these events Prof oh no top secrets what's what's this described as lobbying do some lobbying do some networking uh and I sometimes do some drinking as well big money deal they go hands in hand law is this one you didn't have to do too many crazy ad reads but uh look the I I missed the Grand Final because that's the time my flight from Australia was departing to come back here to cold Malta and I love you Europe um I'm not miserable at all uh so so what sell the final to me how was it oh okay so well for me uh after the fall final it was Vitality phase fall final so when they came into this final again I said privately to everybody I I thought Vitality were going to destroy phas without you know I didn't want to have to like I'm C I'm not on the desk so I'm not gonna bring that up right uh but I really thought that Vitality would destroy faas and they pretty much did so I think that's for a few reasons I think it's can in retrospect kind of an expected result I think it was very fun to watch them play that well and I think uh for me that solidifies Apex as igl of the Year wow okay [ __ ] that in in the cast yeah because I didn't realize it at that moment but thinking about the fact that he won he's two for two with Mesi he won with flames a Gamers eight he's won without zonic which a lot of people said oh here's the fall off now you need Sonic everyone realize on Sonic well watch that [ __ ] Apex still here winning so Apex still winning I think a I was a number one Apex hater 2020 when he took a break I said don't come back and when he came back and started winning I was like damn he's actually good I was just joking I did I mean don't come back as an igl I was really not looking forward to it but then when he kept winning it kept winning okay okay carried by oh he's getting carried by zyu Z has a worse team than 2018 simple he's carrying a bunch of frauds then Spinx got better I am Rio Paris major SP has been the most improved rifler this year in my opinion at the top level top top level I think he's best in Ro even better than robs actually and I think that uh obviously zyu helps it ton but it doesn't make uh I I think there's something to be said about the fact that Apex could have had flamy and Mesi come into the team two players who could have lived with the word potential floating around their heads for the rest of their careers and no one would have noticed even though we knew they're good you know lots of players you know they're good and could have had an excuse for why his team won one tournament in the year two tournaments like they did since 2019 but they didn't they won two back-to-back events three for flamy two for Mesi Bunch for Apex I think he's done an incredible job yeah I agree with all that I think that I I wasn't I wasn't a Believer when I saw him picking up the ingame lader mantle I think it's been a crazy act that he's been on I think it's fantastic understanding what he need to do mean let's let's not overwrite history the first two years of him being an in-game leader a year and a half him being an ingame leader was an absolute disaster yeah like it just was like he he improved massively I don't know I don't know what change or what it was but I mean he he stepped up in terms of figuring out exactly how he was going to call and how he like to play the game and um in terms of in terms of getting people on the same page of how he wanted to play like it's it's OB it's been a marketed one but the early the early days of it was was gross I'm with you though is in-game leader of the Year probably or for sure have to with with what he's done you got to give a shout out I think in this regard to um to Vitality management I think you know with some of the r changes that have come in with losing zic with losing losing Magis they've they've done a good job of replenishing that bringing flames in um and then eventually bringing Mesi in as well I think are incredible fins for them where they've gotten they've gotten away with losing the greatest coach of all time um a Hall of Fame you know player in magisk and and not not missing a beat so I think the management of Vitality as well is done done a great job getting the right players in there all right well Prof you were there as well and they've just spoken a lot about Vitality in the hole and giving away some accolades here but the uh the actual counter- strike you know you you on the ground lobbying would you were you lobbying for Vitality or for FaZe uh for FaZe I would say really you wanted to see FaZe pick up the w why you big I mean uh you know it's just uh phase I think it would be more interesting because now we have really Vitality kind of taking it away and it's very it's very clear you know who's the best at least at the moment uh also across the year I think it's but it's good don't you think it's good we have a favorite leading into next year right we going to CIT a Vitality of the top dog but we know who's nipping at the but at the same time I think like FaZe with Frozen doing this on their first tournament I think this is a really good result overall not really surprising knowing their like kind of reputation how they usually pretty pretty well but still pretty good result I I think uh it was an interesting final from the perspective of like every Phase game was like super tight and then every fatality game was a blowout so it' be like hm you could just say like all phas are bad but that's not really how it is like they are just like one of those teams that always finds a way back into the game so I was curious if that would maybe happen in the final but it was never there it was just never there I had one more thing about that like in the first like 10 rounds of Inferno I saw what I saw was like carrian in 2020 where you know that like igl Scout meta car glaive a lot of yeah running out through smokes dying for a k dying to see four players outside on nuke and then everyone rotated taking over Lobby pushing ramp or whatever that they were kind of doing that and I was like that kind of is not in fashion right now and there was a few rounds where it got them a few rounds because carrian was getting a very aggressive lurk Hill push through smoke even caught zyu off one time but after those four rounds they just got stomped and I was had this feeling for me when I looked at it that like they were playing as the underdog I feel like FaZe were playing thinking they were going to win the game and I don't know what their thoughts are obviously vital are very hard team to play against but it didn't feel like they had a default based sustainable round based game plan that they felt could go deeper than Vitality because it felt like they were just sort of taking more risks who are the cops coming for right now GTA Toronto so it could be anybody could be anybody no I get that around here too but it's just a little bit late for that all right that's fair enough okay yeah that's interesting right because like said I didn't get to watch the final uh I did watch some of the group stage games in the leadup and some of the other Playoff matches but I didn't get to see the final because of the when it was all going down but I I I wonder if that's because he felt like his calls needed to you know he just needed to call his team into position because they didn't have everything refined is what you'd hope because they've just added a player right which that's interesting that's an interesting little uh viewpoint on it it it didn't feel like FaZe uh individuals and that grand final game were getting the impact that that we normally see them get when I was watching it like I think especially on like Inferno like the kind of like the highlights of things that got rounds started for FaZe was like carrian in B with a ma 10 catching a couple nice timings to open up the bomb site but we didn't see that same production across the board from guys like RS and and rain and obviously Frozen even standing in like enough individual production to get things moving on the map so I think they probably at at the time I would imagine in the match they probably felt like individually a step below and felt like they needed to overcome that with a little bit of like Randomness a little bit of like chaos and and obviously with some calling and it just obviously didn't work out zyu put on a master class on Inferno Z is yeah that's that's good to see the like I think that for me I like the way that the year has ended with Vitality on top because it's their year right you got the major you have all those things that you mentioned before laes with all the roster changes so and then I think it puts a nice little Target on their back and a nice little storyline for us to run with going into 2024 um especially with like the major being early on in the year katav vitza being the second event out the gates essentially we do get to wet our feet with the blast groups just to see how kind of everybody's fairing we still have a few more roster changes that need to come into fruition as I look down the the ranks though right so we got Vitality first phase second there's no point us talking about we already spoke about Cloud Nine we we all I think we all agree they need a [ __ ] Ora uh unless Jason's got his devil on his shoulder and that's not the team anymore and heroic same situation so the ones to talk about I I guess uh G2 Ma and na'vi what was what was everyone's thoughts on on G2 right NEX is standing in he had a couple of good clutches and stuff he didn't look completely like fish out of the water a new team they had that good atmosphere hookie yelling like normal what was the take of G2 while getting to uh to to to be man on the ground there lers did you have any key takeaways with them I did I think that I think it's easy to be hyped when you're winning and I think there seemed to be this undercurrent of criticism about jks that he wasn't hyped in like all their moments to help them get back to like or be a good positive atmosphere but like when G2 were losing Nexa wasn't really doing that necessarily and I don't blame him for that and I don't know it sucks for Nexa because obviously you get called up to G G2 you take the [ __ ] job right but I think that the shoes he has to Phil I think if he's not going to do it on a rating basis or a fragging basis then I don't really necessarily see him as he's not the same tier of positive guy as like Jax and like maybe JL a JL exactly those are the two prime examples so picking Nexa up to be a positive guy on the team is sort of a strange concept to me like he wouldn't be on that necessarily not he's never struck me as a negative person but there are some really interesting narratives though that are starting to spawn out of this whole like jks situation it's quite fun to read them one thing I will say for sure is I was very surprised by how well he integrated initially and on G2 I was like thinking okay they'll survive this but then there were a couple of spots particularly CT Inferno uh playing pit and a couple of other spots where I thought jks would have won this map so I think that can't be as good as jks in certain positions and he's also playing new roles that he only played years ago in certain positions so I don't expect him to even once he learns them be better than jks in those roles I don't think he or anybody else even thinks that that's necessarily going to happen um and then I don't think that he's going to be a Jax or J PMA sort of cheerleader for the roster either so I don't think that this ends up being a roster that works though I will say better than I expected originally yeah what about I was going to say what about you Prof because I know that you uh you weren't sold on this move initially have you been this way at all I kind of understand it better now and I I don't I think like obviously like the POS positivity is one aspect I think you can also just say just the energy I think if you say energy I think that's a fair thing that NEX is bringing because like just being in the room when they're playing it is there there is more of a there is more talking going on like it is J even if he was talking you wouldn't hear him in the room that's for sure like he's not really a you know a h man yes also a honeymoon though right come the [ __ ] on I'm just saying we doing I'm just saying I understand that angle I still think first of all I I think P G2 did an awful job of communicating about this because like if they wanted to say they could have said jks is an amazing player but we needed something else to make the other pieces work and we can't remove any of the other pieces because they're Untouchable uh they could say that in a nicer way but that is the truth so we decided to remove jks and uh we hope that other players will you know fill the Gap you know bridge that difference between like jks and EXA that exists [ __ ] obviously and he was just put in this position where he needs to be [ __ ] jks essentially which he cannot be ever and also you could be [ __ ] somebody that hot and also op optimistic positive calling secondary calling and also like being one of the like individually best anchors in the game like that that's that's impossible it's stupid so um I do I do see it now I understand it but I don't I don't think it's enough like I don't think it's I don't I understand the logic but I think that the players that they picked to change are not going to give what they need to be better no I mean my my view of this move when it happened was this is if anything at best like a lateral it's like a change of a player that doesn't actually improve the team significantly over what it was before the change you might get some different elements into it but it's not going to make them it's not going to make them jump up and be a significantly better team than they were before or find some you know I guess the big knock on G2 throughout this whole year was consistency of like winning the katav and cologne and not being able to carry it through to the events between those this doesn't change anything and I didn't see anything at this event that made me think that this was some significant upgrade that was GNA change my opinion of of G2 so um it's it's whatever I think it's fitting if we're we've been having a conversation about the the positive energy that he brings into a team is like if that's the focal point of the conversation on Nexa coming into this roster it's not a good move like it it hasn't provided them any significant change in the way they play the game inside the server whatever like he can bring all the positivity in the world but I don't think it's going to increase the performance of G2 I I I'm not even GNA say I was disappointed in their run it wasn't a great run it was it's just it's what what I expected I mean you beat you beat males 2 oh who has a standin you lose to faze you lose to na'vi who still has question marks on how this swapped to an international roster there's nothing there's no great positive takeaway from this for G that na'vi game was also a classic G2 game I love the clutch that they lost that was my favorite thing that I've seen yeah that that was that was mental that was that was actually really stupid that that was embarrassing that's what that is that like again nothing's changed it's the G2 we've known for years like great good change I'm not going to say anything everything I say gets taken out of context so regarding this we'll just I'm not going to yeah I'm not going to put my my hat in the ring here but I will say once you know that the guy's in library because he's killed your teammate and you still keep running towards b as if you're hunting as if he's going to be there unacceptable just [ __ ] what are you doing that that's embarrassing as [ __ ] that is that was the dumbest [ __ ] I've [ __ ] seen it honestly doesn't make sense cuz if there's two guys seeing alive maybe you could be doing something GRE but there's literally no reason there's literally no one else yeah it just it yeah yeah you could yeah I see what you're saying yeah I I have no I have no idea what was going on that round that was it was that's just [ __ ] dumb brains just disconnected from their bodies yeah where's the [ __ ] positive energy in that moment bch that's the thing that game came down to like emotional composure and they both like when monesy had the 1v5 then G2 came back from 5- zero down to winning the map then Alexi had the 1v3 to fuse then uh na'vi came back in from down and won the map Lally yeah emal damage don't get one V3 ninja diffused Taz wrote that down I'm sure the first meeting I forgot that Taz is gonna have to now be the [ __ ] new one lead in the Asylum over there that's going to be that's GNA be an interesting little project for Taz isn't it I wonder how it's gonna Fair going into little Serbia and having to uh you know try and work he he should have ended up over and [ __ ] what it is Prof what are you talking about management and everything the mental coach the the core of the team it's it's just it it's it's a Serbian team were were they not allowed were they not allowed to use him as a coach due to like a roster lock or something at that event I don't know either that or they just wanted to give one more to Swan but probably roster lock I'd say yeah because I mean if if you're really trying to improve like energy with inside a team why wouldn't you put Taz in there to Hype up the boys during a timeout you know like Taz has got some [ __ ] energy to get to yeah if we're gon if we're gonna have a talk about energy that's true I like P I don't think he's last six months of this team if I'm completely honest I I think this wor why such a clash of everything and there is like so much pressure always on G2 and he's been out of the game for a while on like a top level I don't know I I don't see him because people take him as like expr therefore you know expert I do see him more as a you know just Vibes guy yeah he's a personality management coach that's I imagine that's what they brought him in for personality management handling disputes handling you know mindset going into games more than anything tactical I would imagine but they but they have a tactical in- game leader right so this the thing like I think hookie hookie can carry that burden it's the same kind of thing with like a carrian right like he's going to be able to it's great to be able to have other people to chip in with ideas but they don't need people doing the game plan for them right they they they like doing that hookie is a guy that loves to prepare for matches so and I'm sure T is going to have some some very valuable insights in certain things but yeah I think it will probably be more just to to keep them in line uh what about na'vi we've mentioned them a little bit here uh is the team starting to grow on everybody a little bit more imma had a good map that seemed to get some Romanian Counterstrike fans excited it's always good when he has one good M he's still he's still in my opinion not a real he's not really tier one compared to other people that are being he's being compared to I think I I hate to put it like that but I don't think that he's as developed in his roles he's only recently started being used well in the first place with Alexi but it's actually gotten better now but I don't think he's like he's not like comparable to like he could he had a great map versus ni on nuke but I don't think that's that's not happening every day I made I made a tweet during the event and I said that they don't have any certified Stars they have players who have shown potential who can be stars like bit for that patch when naari were [ __ ] sick if he had kept that up that form up you know as as a player and an anchor he could be amazing right you had yeah you have Emma who had the amazing major run but he hasn't been able to back that up and it is just been this sporadic map every now and again or most of the time he's just got a face like a slapped ass just not looking like he's having a lot of fun right that's probably changing now that simple's not in the team with him but whatever he needs to he needs to deliver he's in a role in the team where he has to deliver and then wonderful well we're only just seeing him on our screens at top level Counter Strike now can he develop he's real quick he's he's quick like Mony does he have what it takes and I also think one of the issues I noticed with na'vi when watching them play is there a team who's going through the system and the approach that what blade and Alexi want they're not playing outside of the box whereas there was like this gear shifted during the G2 game on Anubis where G2 were like okay well we're in this position we're going to have this gear shift you guys were highlighted it while you were casting I think I think you were casting aters um and and they just had this clear like gear shift they were making more plays they were making more moves they were the ones kind of dictating the game whereas na'vi they were getting caught off by things they knew were coming there was like this the the T stairs smoke that came down wonderful still plays ahead of it to go pick a main and hookie pushes down canals and kills him in the back he's like well how the [ __ ] did he get here it's like of course was quite telegraphed they're doing an aggressive move right there was just this like laps they were just doing probably what they were told from Alexi what they were there to expect and I think that's something that na'vi can grow into like I think they can grow into being you know star players or having more impact within games but that's going to take time and they need to be comfortable willing to do that under the tutelage of Alexi and blade and I don't think they're there yet like JL is my favorite player to watch in that team yeah me too I think he makes the least mistakes I I actually believe that too I think he I think wonderful wonderful is just like on the right Trend perfect Trend he's really new he's getting better he's already like as fast as some of the competition needs to be faster then and he has some big moments he can get better and they're actually using him for more tactical openings he's still very shy when it comes to like all right I'm gonna try this if I get you know one flash I'm never going to say oh I don't trust that flash I'm gonna stick around he'll always fall back so I think they get something out of him on good opening calls out of rounds but he's still very like a Soldier I think and not so much like a superstar you know a teeth gritting mindset or whatever um I think Alexis definitely got better over the year and I would assume that's because of Blade I think he's calling his best right now but uh they needs to be even better and five months ago or something imemo was being used completely incorrectly he was being used an aggressive lurk on tside he had no idea when to slow down when to speed up he was very bad at lurking and now he's being used a lot better he was the entry on some rounds on the tside of nubis he was lurking a little bit but not too much and I think he also had some roles like tside Nuke where he was able to play with the pack and without the pack and beat up players like Nico so I think he's showing a lot of improvement too so in my opinion na'vi are improving on almost everybody and JL is the guy who is probably the most impressive because he's also one of the guys who got overrated from Paris and had one good tournament and then got a contract but he hasn't ever in that time been overly criticized for making bad mistakes because he never really made them I think he's really smart yeah it's interesting with the Gile impact within the team and that's the thing I I guess yeah he was he did get the hype from the major but he's he's I would say more living up to it than most yes Jason I think this is just I mean I think it's the reality of when this EMA pickup from na'vi happened it was like the biggest it was like the biggest post major like Risk I feel like taken to a certain extent in terms of roster changes because he was someone that we do nothing about and then had an MVP level performance at the major and that showcased like all the potential he had but we knew he wasn't going to be a finished player and that was the big risk that na'vi took and at the moment it hasn't really realized I think Maniac put it really good on the desk and and in summing up navi's run was just like we don't we don't really know what imma's level is because all we have is like the ceiling like all we've seen is that one great event out of him we're still waiting to see when that next step up in his development comes in and that's where we can start judging a little bit more if you just kind of Judge it based off what we saw in Paris and then how it's been in na'vi obviously it's it's been a it's it's not been good in any you don't get the call up to a team like na'vi without the performance in Paris yeah exactly and but I mean we just have to see him continue develop and flesh out the rest of his game because he's never he hasn't been in tier one for very long like it's still very early on so they've na'vi made this roster change with his ceiling and his potential in mind and then it's about the development game and we's still obviously in that development phase I mean it's it's just it is it is what it is if you're at least you don't have to teach him to not be nervous right like at least if you're played and you see that happen and you go like here's here's something we can carve out at least you know that when the major final comes around or major semis he's still going to play as good as he knows how to play and not really think about the circumstances I think I think the question the question that I think IMA is gonna have to answer in the next few months leading up into the next major is how much time can he buy himself like if if it gets to the next post major cycle and there's like a star right who's been performing well and shown that he's consistent and shown that he understands the you know the game if na'vi has an opportunity to go out and pick someone up in his place they do it or does he buy himself back yeah simple coming back is also a reality like for for for him or wonderful right whoever is not doing the best I think those are the two players that make the most sense to be to be cut so we simple can Rifle right like she doesn't have to be the OPA I I with the guardian thing it didn't age too well but I remember back then when I was like simple doesn't have to all like he doesn't need to I think you know it might work a little bit better if he's if he's you know I think the guardian thing was also he was watching like an an oper at like the tail end of his career from what his exactly he was like I gave up oping so this [ __ ] like what like no that's not he did the same thing in liquid remember with Custer when he joined my boy Custer he did the same exact thing and I think it was a very similar sentiment with Guardian so I think if he comes back and he's got someone like wonderful where he actually sees and respects the potential um hypothetically speaking the reason why all these players op is because they have to like if you like uh zyu didn't want to op he tried to stop when NOA joined the team he didn't op on Inferno he didn't up on a few Maps he still barely Ops just so amazing at everything that you don't even notice because he hits all the few shots that he takes and then simple tried to quit the up a few times that was horrible he had to watch his team lose when he knows that if he opt they probably would have had a better chance of winning and then even device he was like when fetish was on the team with device device was just a star rifler because he was the best with the weapon he just that's how it always goes that's why device is the Cs goat yeah they all I mean they all ended up they're all just the best players in the team best with every weapon most important weapons they are they all up yeah kind of makes sense connecting the dots right there all right uh let's do this Prof is Brolin not is has Brolin done enough to get himself a spot on mes I don't have the stats I can just like see from what I watched in the games I think B based I think he really uh he played much better than anyone gave him credit or expected from him except me because I'm a br no not really I'm not going to go that far like I also have been really disappointed in what we saw him but people have really convinced me that he was only ever good with like the AUG and C which is not true and he has better than what he's shown on nip and like and a fanatic whatever and um I think what he showed in mouse is like he is still a relevant player and can be you know on a on a decent team is he like candidate for faas right now definitely not but if he stayed on on Mouse could be could be okay I don't think they should stick with that I think there is like exciting more exciting options on the market right now that they can get that they should go for uh names and names Prof who do you think jks any others uh I mean nurs was one but that didn't uh obviously didn't happen those are the two first that come to mind for me J's buyout dependent what are they going to keep them on the bench forever like it's in their interest to move on as well G2 look like they're selling a lot of stuff right now so I guess they need to make as much money as they can now let's say brol it actually had potential right let's say it's real best no no no hold on hold on let me get there wait wait wait let me get there all right so he actually has I'm living in that world I do think he does that's what I 21 he's 21 years old he has never played with a great igl never Sweden had none pampus was the best but he he didn't even have any Idols he literally taught himself everything what's that he played with flusher no yeah but f is one of the greatest players of all time but not a great igl I'm logging that one up to some dry humor okay all right all right okay okay who's the great IG he play who's the great that he played with let's start there I don't know okay so he's never played with a great igl sh's the best igl that he's played with all right so this is a cool test in my opinion for shuy okay shuy is getting a new player on the team can he make Brolin play to the level that everyone thought that Brolin could for the last few years because I think that a great igil can make a great player play with Alexi uh another thing for you Chad you said JK Chad has a huge buyou I didn't say huge buyer I just said it depends on the buyer yeah but broland isn't free either like after huge [ __ ] numbers for him and H being asked for by nip I don't know if that changes because that was no surprise there that was kind of a thing that was rumored around the time when like the Swedish lineup was potential you know blah blah uh then sorry one more thing I'll just say Alexi Alexi Shou is better now than Alexi was okay I'll say that at the time yeah okay all right all right because a lot of people were saying Alexi he's defending himself here prop all right so a lot of high buy and yeah so I don't know if that's um a thing that works out right it seems like whoever it is is going to be have to be some sort of a buyout right um okay but if you're going to buy buy out the player would you rather buy out brolan or jks I'd probably lean toward jks but uh again well how far away to mes feel like they're from winning I suppose right like if they think that they can win now then I would say get jks if they feel like they want a bit more time to develop than I'd say go with Brolin because he's goingon to be a benefit for the team he's more around the age of everybody being 21 this team I feel like this team already spent their year in development right like this was like the academy this this has been like an academy team for two years they just won pro league right at the end of CSO and it's like it felt like that should be like the moment right that should be that should be the one jimy out of nowhere you guys sh yeah I know but like that's if revived revived is huge I mean if I'm if I'm M I'm basically just going to shui and I'm saying who do you want bro well yeah well they probably will go that way right you but that's the thing as well like we always know mes is not this or that's like a massive spender I'm sure they have some money to throw around but I I I'm surpris they're not just getting an academy people are saying uh I guess you have yeah yeah yeah sorry sorry I just zoned out no I was gonna say I guess it depends on like it's kind of in the vein of Chad whereas like do are you in win now mode or you are in like win win in the future mode and develop roling a little bit longer but also like are you trying to replace Frozen or are you trying to you know fit what you feel the team team needs because like you know Frozen and jks are two very different players yeah people are saying like gyat and jks have overlap but like that did play Star roles in the academy team and then got into the main team and he's he can handle his business and then he can just go back to S rolles but just think about like Mirage for example Jimmy plays B jks was playing a yes and then you'd have your I'm talking about CT side and then You' probably have like shuy the probably connector it have exertion short and you'd have toy window right like that that works that works right if we're worrying more about t- sides in terms of like lurs and positions like that uh I'd be interested to you have two extremity players your pack would probably still be what exeron shuy and toi like that would still be your pack so I don't know I think so yeah think closer to Frozen than Brolin is for sure yeah yeah whereas like Brolin is more aggressive of a player like when we had shuy on the show is talking about maybe being able to play some more fast Counter Strike which I think you know definitely has its Merit um but I I I just I think if you going by what most people have as kind of the blueprint at the moment JK would make more sense but they think that they have a lot of good young players in that team that could do a lot of things I think exertion is a great player I really I don't think he always shows that I just but from the glimpses and the way he talks about the game I think he's a fantastic player so yeah I don't know I'm not sure what's gonna happen with ma but um if if jkss can get over there that' be great I don't I don't know I'm not sure I I really really don't know what's going to happen with poor little Justin um so we we'll see what happens with the kid but um yeah like I said I better not talk about it because you know wouldn't want to talk about my my friend guys that makes me PR agent and all that kind of good stuff I think he should just wait basically because he's got like like yeah I think a lot of roster moves as a player you're probably thinking like well let's try not to blow my stock and just wait for someone it's like at least a lateral move if not an upgrade and then if I have to work on making a team better to get past where my team was previously right why would you waste time otherwise yeah you wouldn't want to pull a glaive either yeah going too fast can be he took a bit he took quite a break though maybe it was just awkward timing you know how it is there's a lot going on all the time there's a lot going on all the time all the time gentlemen I have uh we got to do skinet this evening do you guys want to get in a bit of a quiz here you guys want to you guys get to work together on this one here all right let's do this Demetri you ready two brain cells me and mo right here yep all right well I will say that the last question of the five is

five questions multiple choice each question you get correct moves the arrow up and we get closer and closer to potentially giving away a one wrong answer is uh is is we're done no you're not done we just stalled out you know you just you just can't achieve the $50 and someone at home will get a uh we get a voucher type trade it in chat right now for your chance to enter the raffle whatever these

is it 2 250 250 it's all it's all grainy on the monitor when I maximize so I think the question I can't even read the question it's all grainy all right all right Fifth and final question here for this evening of Who Wants to be a skin you no brought it to by Trader Dogg how many different players competed under the Vitality Banner in 2023 was it S8 or ning it's they replaced they replaced flames and Mesi are the only two players they brought in this year right I'm [ __ ] scared right [Laughter] now like wait they're players you're counting Grand Slam as money coaches players no

a bad trajectory we started out so well we did we did start off really good and I'd like to say congratulations to official Raz that is uh official R you are the winner of a 50 Cent skin um our people will reach out to your people and it don't spend that don't spend that whole thing in one place maybe get two skins with that yeah don't report report oh that was a fun little trip down memory Ling this is 100% this is by far the worst performance wait I'm still I'm still gonna plant my flag that the IGS is not prize money I just want to throw that out there that's a debate that you guys can have at another time uh I'll die on that hill Oh my God that was great okay that was really good thank you guys I appreciate that thank you Trader Dogg for making that all possible and uh the point of that was to be a segue into just us reflecting on the year gentlemen um it's a bit like Counterstrike Thanksgiving now The Season's wrapped up we've had another another nice year lots of lots has happened uh I was wanted to wonder if you guys had any any favorite moments like personally or or tournament wise anything that blew your socks off anything that you were really disappointed by that happened within the year does anybody want to start anybody got anything at the tip of their tongue uh I would say uh like a person I know what you're gonna say what am I gonna say if you don't say well I think you're gonna say what I'm gonna say write it down on TeamSpeak and and we'll check after the fact I was gonna say a a personal a personal favorite of mine um was actually uh going going to the Fraga kago event just recently like the the going back to like the old school land style it's not a it's not a big one I'm just getting I'm just getting us warmed up chat I'm just taking the first step down the road getting everyone into it all right just getting the old school like land environment Vibes going on rows of tables six matches at a time [ __ ] yelling across the room [ __ ] talk when they win a clutch um that was good that was really good and I mean to piggyback on that too is having events with the players facing each other again this year happened a couple times that we don't normally get which I think was was actually really really cool to see the players interact during live matches as well um I think that's a factor a facet of of tournaments that should that should be here to stay yeah yeah that's right okay a couple of nice ones I thought you were going to say going to Atlanta and not Atlanta going to Seattle and testing the game oh yeah that was a pretty moment as well yeah I enjoyed that too that was cool that was like Christmas that was like all of my Christmas coming at once right that was that was amazing like just to get the kind of emails coming from them and stuff and then obviously we had to sign the NDA and we didn't know who was going and we rock up and you seeing all these different people there and just getting to see the office I never thought I never thought I would have that opportunity um so that that for me that is the biggest and best uh thing within the year without a doubt I've got let me let me just plug something CS related for next year the beginning of next year before I say mine so I would do organizing a local L with rivalry so in in Toronto if you're in Toronto it's a $5,000 local January 6th at the Red Bull gaming studio and you can sign up my links on my Twitter if you're in Toronto B old school five grand Jason just reminded me of that and I'll be there and if you're you want to cast we can all cast together me Mike's casting uh room setup and everything like that and it's uh tickets are limited so if you're in Toronto come to that you need a team hit me up if you need a fifth yeah yeah yeah Moses will play with you and um my favorite thing in that same vein is that we did watch parters earlier this year and that was so cool to like see to do an event in Toronto that's like 200 people come to watch we watched imem Rio together that's really the the grand finals and you know it's like 200 250 people came the bar was oversold and we did it two times and uh doing watch parties reminds you of all the good things that we love about the game just like Jason saying going to a land seeing people who are they're just like they're playing more of a community Vibe right exactly there's some tourists at bigger events you know what I mean so you can't always know when people come up and they say I'm a big fan of yours or they love counter- strike you know tourists are totally fine but it's cool to kind of get to like the really core fans uh in situations like that like local lands and watch parties so that you know reminded me about everything I love about the game and then uh obviously casted the major final which is a bucket list and that that was an incredible experience as well um so yeah that was the two coolest things and then also just every year going to new countries is like my favorite thing like going to new places um to do CS events is like like this this year at the end of the year we were following along with F1 basically because we were in Vegas for the Esports Awards and then we went to Abu Dhabi and both time there was like the week before was like a race for F1 and I just realized like wow we actually like travel more than these guys like it's pretty amazing how many places that we get to see every year and you're not jaded by the travel yet you still enjoying it I still love it just I'm just an Explorer like inside like I will go I would literally do an event in North Korea if they had one I I will go anywhere dude I bomb shows on the show I love I love I love just exploring like all my all the YouTube videos I watch like some dude the Taliban and Afghanistan like hanging out with them or like I just watched bald go to do the Darian cross uh on the you know to try to sneak into the US and he went with these people to do and I it's just like I love just seeing new places meeting new people especially if they don't speak English especially if like everything's totally forign I want to eat their food hang out with their families talk to them like I just love it so this is like the perfect job for me personally I just love the traveling and if I go to the same places over and over again it loses the novelty but to go new places every year I feel like it's the biggest blessing yeah okay that's a nice way to look at it what about you Prof you got anything that's stuck out for you this year um I think the the show we did in Paris was really cool I think that was like our best live show yet we had like a great team there and uh of the their production and then our stuff that we prepared for the show like the nice screen the setup launders came in for a bit I think it was also what you're saying about like the watch parties I think that's kind of true also for for these podcasts like we don't sell that many tickets mostly because the the venues are really limit limited so it's only the people that are literally waiting for it to drop to get tickets so everyone that's there wants to be there doesn't have like they're not there just ah I'm GNA watch a bit and then just like zone out everyone just like interacting we did these little the papers so we had some like interactivity and stuff like that so I think it was a a really cool vibe there so if we can do more shows like that that would be kind of kind of it just felt like a real talk show you know it really felt like a proper it was TV show so that's uh it just shows that we can do good stuff in CS yeah that's obviously one of the things we've been doing a bit more the last couple of years and you're the a big proponent of making those things possible Right same with this award show you I don't even know how he started that to be honest yeah they're good fun yeah well but that's that's good and then the award show of course like I think that's up there uh the first to cool yeah that that was pretty sick and I think uh had we had no idea what it was going to look like like obviously you can do you can make everything the best but if people don't show up and if they don't really give anything you know if they just come and say thank you take the word and go and leave it would be like kind of [ __ ] right but everyone came up I think when Axel was the first guy that like came up and he was like had a whole [ __ ] speech I'm like this guy didn't speak this much ever I didn't ever see him speak this much and he's like in front of an audience that usually kind of makes people kind of shrink and just be like ah please let me leave me alone uh so that was that was insane that was really nice and then obviously we're going to do it again this year I think those two things combined with working the major that was kind of a lucky thing that happened um and it was amazing amazing experience not something that I would have expected to ever do so that's cool it's like a it's an award show the launders can actually win okay that's crazy J just throw and you're the one who the traded give away okay not me I was waiting to get that one out there props just kept going and going I was I was loaded up I was ready whaty hell yeah look that there' been a lot of fun things throughout the year I'm just trying to reflect like event wise I think Sydney was fun like it being get casting with Henry as well with with me and Alex I think we did a lot during the the online era we get a lot of comments from people um that we you know either via I get a lot from Instagram people know you know it was great watching you guys during the online ERA with all that with obviously the pandemic stuff and then the fact we got to do that was kind of nice to do that TR the cashes show match is always a lot of fun because we get to just be fools and do a little bit of like WWE style shtick so that's always good fun but yeah it's the year went by pretty quickly I think another one that's just kind of this year's been a weird year for Counter Strike obviously with CS2 coming out and only having one major in the year and just coming out of the P well just coming out of the pandemic not that long ago and then we've had all this roster stuff I think a big influence of that was Falcons coming into the space and this latter half of the year has just kind of been a bit mky and messy yeah the CS2 swap over has created a lot of chaos there's a a few months in there that it felt like we were all just kind of in limbo and so those those went by really quick I feel yeah I think we're still kind of in limbo though that's that's the thing next year we're going to kind of just be wobbling into place and then as the year closes in 2025 that's when I think we'll find oursel in a good spot with the major being the final event of the year and we might go to because come 2026 sorry come 2020 next year only 2024 [ __ ] hell I just lost a year uh come 2025 that's when we have you know the majors the last events before the player breaks or the tournament break so that's when we kind of get into what we've wanted for probably the better part of the last decade um so that that should be good fun um I think the first pro League season I really enjoyed the second one I don't think I enjoyed as much hopefully we can keep a few fingers out of a few pies for the next Pro League season that we do Jason we'll see if we can you know hopefully what does what does that mean what does that say mean it means we like our pie mean yeah we we like at the out way fingered no we'll finger we'll finger our own p we like we like fingering our own Pi I know exactly how I like to finger my pies exactly and we want to finger them our way that's that's all Prof we don't want them to be fingered any other way um your favorite pie lemon pie um in Australia we have more Savory pies I like a good chunky beef pie sure that's not bad I I enjoy I'm I'm American I enjoy apple pie okay what about pecan pecan is pretty good hard to find a good pecan pie though the blueberry crumble is is also nice it's a good it's a good switch up what's the pie of Canada launders is there is there a favorite pie in Canada syrup pie pumpkin maybe I don't know exactly if there's a favorite I like pumpkin though I right pumpkin's a solid pie everyone oh lemon merang pie coming in here from Connor we love a bit of that no no one likes lemon merang pie no it's it's a Million Dollar Baby reference and I was like but he he hasn't seen the movie oh we literally had this conversation I was there oh right yeah because because you said this and now it's like yes but is the best actually yeah okay uh well look Gentlemen Just quickly here for I'm going to read through a couple of bits and Bobs because I tried to do some crowdsourcing with some tweets over the last couple of weeks to get some people to tweet in and a lot of it just like flooded with recency Buyers uh which which does tend to happen um I was asking for just like people the the community like people on Twitter like the moments they enjoyed or didn't enjoy whatever and this I'll just read up a couple here uh decadent said least favorite moment the ultimate downfall of Swedish CS do we think this year was the death knock for for Swedish Counterstrike is it [ __ ] D now this is like one of the best years in some recent memory for Swedish CS wasn't it in terms of an nip giving up it is but then also like at the same time the subtop as the French like to call it has been better than ever actually yeah true it that look like it's thriving more so we got to burn it down before we can really start again like snip Sweden has been on a down Cline since resz was MVP at Oakland in 2017 that was like the best then it's just literally literally it's never gotten better since then and then uh device gave it some hope you know even like an import but can win a tournament this year and say I'm the best Swedish Talent or we're the best Swedish team that's pretty cool I think so most trophies of any swed yeah um what else we got here we got uh one obviously the heroic astralis drama being the highlight of the year that was pretty juicy uh that was that that would have to be one of the top dramas of the year the and and a great nickname being born from that so that was a nice one I did enjoy that one were there any other dramas that stood out to people in terms and I don't know if we can talk about them as highlights of the year but were there any other like juicy little because it's hard when you try and reflect back on the year to remember all of them because there's usually so many do any anyone remember anything fun like that that was like I think G2 was a pretty like what the hell happened uh I guess EG leaving Esports sort of I mean there's a bunch of E stuff was e complaining about the talent being mean this year oh yeah oh yeah we had to stop doing the jokes on broadcast that was this year oh my God yeah that was the first season that was the first the s that was a good segment that was good that was a great segment last major trophy yeah they got really upset they were like oh you're going to stop doing it people are going to lose their jobs and then now the or was going under which is was it because of you I hope so apparently I hope it was because of the joke oh there was the URL [ __ ] on them thing that happened just recently that was a hilarious didn't you work that into a cast the other I did because it just sort of jumped out and I said that and then I was like probably shouldn't but too funny it was too funny oh someone's brought up the J cranny situation the the swishes down scenario that was uh that was first season of of pro league I think as well yeah uh that's that's not bad someone's brought that one up into the into The Fray here they got versus naon which was pretty good that's that has to be copy pastor of the year though don't that doesn't that's a good copy pasta yeah that one has to be up there um that's a new award for the [ __ ] show copy past out of the year yeah for sure it needs to be it 100% needs to be um people are bringing up the BL hedger thing that was that was interesting um yeah what else we got here that's it pipeline yeah it's getting I I don't keep I don't keep drwing in my memory I delete that I only have so much space and I don't want it to be it's fun it's fun temporarily we all I don't I don't know what is in there judging on the on the skin he doesn't have space for drama no space for trivia nothing he's right I don't I'll be honest I don't he's got a dad brain right that he's allowed that like once you're a dad true you're allow you're off the hook mate you're off the hook I have there was there was at the Paris major there was a sequence of like three days where I just like lost [ __ ] in the Caster room and I would be like Chad uh if you see this like I don't know where anything is if you find this I think I left my watch at your house like yeah I got it it's all good we got it wor can't find it anywhere it's [ __ ] it was wild times oh the bank's hot mic was just putting chat that was fun yeah they didn't remember drama um was in chat simple stepping down is kind of a big deal um that is cassad versus hookie oh yeah that was a big one too that was funny I was I was watching I was watching I love that dude the death segment was great oh when cassad the desk right right after he won cologne going onto the desk with cassad yeah yeah yeah yeah some good stuff there oh yeah Pasha biked to Paris from Poland which was like a multi-day journey right to catch it was so sad because it was in order to catch nine playing if they survived through this Legends stage was it Legends yeah Legend eliminated heed the day eliminated the day after they got eliminated but I was talking to shui and I was like yo did posha reach out to you he's like no I'm like dude you didn't even know that shui was there getting to the major final he was doing it for you too posha you didn't know yeah you're there for nine Shou was there the whole time the Maui Z cultural impact I don't because Z doesn't play back into any of that it's Apex who cares more about that than I think zes even have Z doesn't have media he doesn't know what the [ __ ] Z's got a little bit of swagger though to him these days he's starting to he's starting to get it he's starting to get his own style it's not going to be like the ego the outspoken that we all wanted but he's he's got his own little Swagger in interviews these days okay yeah all right he's coming for simples records bro like the MVPs it's within reach he's one behind device now and three behind simple in terms of MVPs I think yeah okay that's not bad we something to look forward to next year we were going to look at the Cavit spots and the RMR stuff but me and Prof and Striker can do that in the next episode we're going to do which will be after Christmas we'll probably do that around the 27th or the 28th that'll give us a bit of news to do we might make a bit of a more personal episode there but uh yeah gentlemen you got anything else you really want to get off your chess this evening anything that's been bothering you before we go into uh the Christmas time just around the corner all of what six days away to Christmas day or if you're in Europe you guys do it on the 24th because you guys are [ __ ] weird I do it on 25th or [ __ ] off okay well you're not weird then the Germans do it on the 24th yeah that's their problem opening gifts like at night do it after midnight do it after midnight no now what happens is so in Germany I don't know how many other countries this is the case what happens and if you get little kids listening right now I'm sorry I don't know why they're listening to four [ __ ] dudes talk about Counter Strike and swear their heads off so they they lock and [ __ ] they lock the kids in like a bedroom and then Santa comes in so someone gets dressed the [ __ ] up as Santa and then he puts the gifts under the tree at night time on the 24th and then Santa leaves uh and then the kids come out and open the presents at night time on the 24th that's weird yeah tell me about it that's that's unique yeah I haven't I haven't really heard that before yeah that's that's true though that's what happens that's that's what happens in Germany apparently unless I'm getting lined to over here but yeah that's that's what the case is so as well yeah the Dutch put carrots in uh their shoes and leave them outside the door for the reindeer okay better in the shoe than else I don't know I didn't ask that question they're standing up so they can see them what yeah maybe yeah get a good good angle on the bite sure let's go with that you know what my parents used to do uh that someone said that's not true I'm sorry I guess I got it wrong I've been I've been misinformed um what my parents used to do CU in Australia obviously we don't have any snow at Christmas time because it's normally about 35° outside they'd put like talcum powder like outside on like the where the where the water and stuff would be left for the reindeer as if they had been able like the snow had stayed like it was meant to be fake snow like okay of course that's not [ __ ] snow how could it be snow it's 35 I just use cocaine yeah well that hey look that that might be cheaper where you're from L I don't know how much know know that [ __ ] ain't going cheap uh well there was a question here that Prof wanted to ask someone in chat wanted to ask that he put in for later it said Can Moses and law just talk about the future the future of what just talk about the future casting okay we'd like to announce ourselves as a Duo anything else yeah and we'll obviously be really well prepared with all trivia information across an entire calendar year I also love the extension of the question what happened to Henry and Hugo disappear seems like Henry yes h obviously sorry what's the question what happened to Henry and Hugo he meant what happened to Harry and Hugo right this has been Mis miswritten the guy obviously it's usually H who's mistaken for Henry as well so it's he got layers to it said said they disappeared near the end of well they just haven't worked in like three months um disappear disappeared near the end of the year seems like Henry G and Anders are ready for next year so that's such an interesting question that you posted there Prof um it's it's a question it's multifaceted it's multi what do you think can you give one a talent based prediction for next year Talent based prediction for next year starting with you Chad Talent based prediction do you expect any changes within the people casting yeah I don't think so probably not for next year I've got about three years left in me so I can announce that I'm I'm I have a Duo I'm how many years you have less Moses oh I got I got plenty dog I got I got plenty in the tank ready to go if I make it through three mate I'll have done well you can do it fing hell you're going to make it through three yeah you're not nearly as unstable as you like to pretend you are we got an event in North Korea that's when I'll retire because he won't be coming back so done I'll have no motivation after that did it all [ __ ] H [ __ ] H face predictions uh no not really probably be no we have a good crew right now there's not even we don't even get blowups at the majors anymore more which used to be like a really fun thing every major had one massive issue and and we're done with that that used to be a tradition why do you think that is Jas we got we got a good levelheaded crew of of non- psychopaths everyone's getting old and boring Psychopaths that's what I can extract from this there's too much mental stability within the talent
