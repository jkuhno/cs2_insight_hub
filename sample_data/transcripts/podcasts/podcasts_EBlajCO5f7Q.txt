confirmed uh the leading Counter-Strike podcast brought to you by 1xb and [Music] traded.to some very exciting topics we had a CS2 update we had a map Pool update and we have two very exciting guests here uh Hooch and art welcome to the show guys yo yo hello thank you so much happy to be here I wanna I want to start with you Nar just just for a second you are uh your time zone not the not the best for the show I uh saw on my phone you're sending me clips for the last like seven hours did you did you sleep or you like on 24-hour grind I woke up at like 5:00 a.m. my time I saw messages from you like do you have any Clips got on my bed and went open the game and just recorded some stuff as you guys see later so now I have uh about 200 clips of which we'll maybe show five um but uh thank you for that there there's some really cool cool stuff um happening with with dust two and and Inferno so I think we can start a bit of a discussion about that um Hooch how are you you're my my colleague on a shitty chair which I need to replace because it started cracking as we started the show so I'll I'll do a little break in in a minute or two uh but how are you doing I'm doing good I'm just thinking about who made the title it's really nice it fits me what is cyber tourist yeah of course I mean that is that is that is something you need to explain what is what is a cyber tourist for those that don't know H it's basically when you go to the tournaments do any job just saying hi and watching games and going for after party but I only did this once so this is when you come in and get destroyed in the like two games yeah something like that we used to to do like this in the beginning of my career so it was a meme uh in Russian uh Community calling everyone who came to the tournament and lost first games a cyber tourist so I know something about that unfortunately I think your sensitivity on the mic is just like a bit uh sometimes it cuts you off yeah just adjust it just a bit but I think team speak sir is that is that kind of a slight on Renegades I feel like that's a slight on Renegades they' they've been cyber touristing for like two years or so how do you feel about that one n I'm wearing this because sponge is not here in placement you know in spirit of him beating Titan in 2015 es clone top fragging 2712 that's a that's a nice shout out that right there for for Chad I think he's going to appreciate that one I think uh for a while no one has mentioned that it's almost going going to become a forgotten a relic of the past just like spude will never let us do that man sponge will never let us forget how are you doing yeah I was gonna say like I love how like just like what 30 seconds before the show went live prop goes like I have this chair for like 10 and it's so so good it's actually not so bad and then like five seconds later he shows something that's like on the chair and it literally we can hear it crack as as he says like okay this is what the chair has and it this is what makes it good you know so as as the host I will I'll I'll just um segue us into the into the first um order of business which is the CS2 update um and I will I'll put out a question let's start with you Striker out of the generally update material that came out that is not the the map Pool is there anything that stands out to you as important for the competitive side like what what the updates that are kind of stood out and I'll run for a second now I mean I'll start with the obvious one it would be Inferno right um outside of the map will change that's probably the biggest thing that that um that happened in the uh in the update and uh I mean I guess we'll we'll we'll see later how much of an effect that will actually have right what do you guys think listening to he's not listening to you actually I sorry sorry continue sorry okay I think uh like the the nade the new nade recticle the new n lineup where you have the long crosshairs I already started seeing Pros use it really that's yeah you were watching streams or who did you see use it it was somebody from zero tenacity cuz I was watching the first pro does two matches okay it's pretty cool to see that you know even Pros are starting to use that feature that was made for you know beginners you have but you have to think that maybe that was like something that that possibly valvo talking to people at the major about because like it was probably something I mean it's been something that's been used for such a long time in different ways you know people have binds that like just literally spend across her for the entire width and height of the monitor right or like the screen so um yeah that's cool uh I'm pretty sure I watched some demos before and like every player who throws the nades had this uh common tone so I think it's maybe demo or maybe everyone is using it I'm not sure but it's really useful I think what about you Hooch anything that's stood out for you from the update um not nothing really I'm just little bit disappointed with the remove of overpass like uh the story behind it I feel like they removed it because it was wasn't so popular in uh premere yeah like I think it's one of the best maps from the beginning of the Counter Strike like when it was published and I feel sorry that it got removed so plus two is a good update but they should have cut of uh Inferno vertigo my opinion I mean I think that's what most people from the from the po pro scene would say uh about removing Maps I think um for me and talking about U things things from the major and speaking to valds I did uh I did ask them why the CZ was still giving [ __ ] kill reward and now it's it has been fixed it has nor normal kill reward so I'm gonna I'm gonna take all the responsibility for this like absolutely game changing update that came through so I think I can get a thank you from like Hunter and maybe one more player that that uses the CZ now does who who else uses the CZ to be honest boage yeah yeah that's true you're mate um I don't have the bar uh Lucas to change the the topics so if you can click through to what is coming next and that would be I think it's we can we can just swap to The Infernal changes because that's that's kind of the first big thing that happened um essentially one of the big complaints that everyone has had with the map is that it feels claustrophobic and that it plays claustrophobic but I think for the most part PE it was the feeling that got addressed with this in terms of changing some of the some of the sky boxes and more or less just decluttering the map so I don't know we can start with you Nar what did you think of the of the update that came I really like the changes to Inferno and it keeps getting better like removing that whole mid thing the the rooftop right here like when I initially got into the game and saw it was removed I freaked out because I was like did they make Inferno wider like mid wider as well I had to like confirm it with my friend but this just allows like a lot more utility being able to be thrown much easier and then like the bottom banana there is also removed and it helps with you know te's having more lineups to you know contest banana because otherwise the te's are more toward like there's a player throwing like the flashes over yeah you have like different lineups but there's a lot more lineups coming out of know these two being removed and it feels less claustrophobic because of these two things being removed as well what what do you think Hooch is it going to make a significant difference though I I don't yeah I don't don't see it making like a huge difference on how the map plays right it's look like some cosmetic difference like don't think in overall it's going to change but to be honest I didn't check it yet yeah I I'll have to say like yeah you're right but cuz I already watched three Inferno demos with these new changes and The Meta is still the same as it previously was all you're getting as like new n lineups honestly yeah to be honest it will take people it takes people quite a bit of time to to adapt to like new possibilities and stuff like that um but overall I think what what most people on the pro scene were complaining about is kind of the rotation times that are very tricky to to deal with as a CT and then just the the huge amount of I do think this is makes the the game a bit more appealing just from a casual standpoint just to like be in it it feels a bit more enjoyable but I don't know Striker do you have anything on on Inferno from a first look before we jump into like some of the some of the smokes and stuff that that Nar sent over I feel like it's almost kind of surprised that they didn't open up like when they already did that they didn't already open up the entire banana because there's still kind of like the overhanging roof like in the middle of it rather than the the one that's like all the way backed I'm kind of surprised that that didn't get removed as well just to just to help with that kind of feel of the map rather than you know not necessarily usability you know because you don't really see people like lining up smokes from the middle of banana too much like where that would go so high where that would be in the way or something you know so maybe like functionality wise it wouldn't be much of a difference but at least feeling wise it would maybe contribute to to Banana like also as a result of moltov being a little bit bigger smokes being a little bit bigger in in CS2 that also contributes to the whole like problem of of Inferno at the moment you know where banana is like much worse than it even used to be in terms of how much of it you could even control with uh with just a few grenades you know so um yeah uh I'm also kind of skeptical about how big of a change it will be but like we know that Pros are the best at kind of like finding ways to abuse changes more than than we kind of anticipate so I guess a lot of it will just uh remain to be seen yeah I can uh actually share my screen to to Lucas so Lucas can when you see it just uh let me know so I can play some of the some of the clips that nard sent over like one of the one of the new smokes um essentio uh no just going to Inferno now the spawn one for example um yeah they move the chairs up so this is just uh this is like another lineup that was used in the past but it still works yeah but CS just have like so much like control with either that smoke or you know the mid the deeper midm smoke that's still being thrown essentially it just allows even more combinations for the CTS that it felt like had already a lot going on right a lot a lot of uh possibilities so I don't know I don't really think it fixes the issues that that's kind of my take on I just think it's kind kind of remains more or less the same map which is something I'm not super super hyped about the previous update they tried moving the the the T spawns up to try to get a better timing on that first smoke that you showed which it worked out but that other smoke the one that lands in deep mid the CTS can't really beat that timing there I mean the t's yeah but uh another thing that that changed that we didn't really touch on is the is the view models um and essentially what is finally allowed is the is the left-and stuff that people have complained about a lot early on but I feel like it's such a weird timing to add this now it feels like people everyone gave up on it but it's but it's in the game now and as narutu pointed out uh in in this video you can actually see the view models now in the game when spectating the client so that's like a little small addition to the to the actual spectator POV and the game from a from just a stream perspective right I don't really see it being anything gamechanging to be honest I don't know a lot of people complained about it not being the same as in CSO but like is was that even realistic or does it change anything I mean it does change certain like Peaks right because like for example like the one Peak that I remember like stio was like a big abuser of the switch like hand switch during the game you know for example and I remember like one specific Peak that he was that he used to do was like from boiler you know as you go down the stairs and you Peak boiler right side you know and you Peak short on Inferno like he constantly switched to to the left hand so that he get has a clearer view of short you know and like if you do that as you peek around the corner and like there's that delay before you can shoot that's a problem you know like you can't you you are going to be at a disadvantage you know so you but then again like you can also do it slightly ahead of time you know like it's just I don't know why they did it that way if it was necessary I'm not sure uh but it just feels like uh maybe they just didn't want people to spam it and like it looking ridiculous you know just like people just go like do it a tick where they just literally spam the button just so something happens on their screen which is I mean it is a bit stupid I don't know if that's what the thinking was behind it but uh yeah I I don't know yeah I mean um it's it's a map that is staying in the map Pool and seemingly it's going to stay for at least a year now uh by the tempo of of valve updating the map Pool which is it is what it is um it had been at at some points in this year it was like super low played but then at the major it got some got some love again but what we are getting is dust two back and I don't think anyone really saw this coming what what who did you see the dust two being reintroduced to the to the map Pool not really I was expect to some map like cash or Cobblestone to come back or this new maps they were announcing for a long time but uh does too like it's definition of Counter Strike so for me I always love this map it's that one said it in the end it was pretty boring but for me this map is was always interesting uh I had like some nice matches as a player and the coach with this so I'm pretty happy I'm just a Inferno hater so I'm just waiting for them to remove this map and like what do what do you think guys the reason why they removed specifically overpass and bring back that too you know what I I was thinking like I was thinking about this and I think the better question is why they didn't remove Mirage which would have been the the one that's the longest time the map Pool I mean it's been there literally since the beginning it's been there for for all of all of the majors so far while overpass was a little bit later uh it was like 2014 for cologne uh so the third major it came in so so so slightly less it was it was in the pool and I would have considered just that as the main reason as like the the longevity of the map um but the reason why they wouldn't do Mirage is exactly because I would imagine it's because it's such a popular map these days it's become like almost more iconic than dust two especially after the recent changes that made dust two a little bit less kind of like casual and it's it becomes a little bit more like um harder for the te's to move around and stuff like that maybe like that's that was a part of why dustu stop being played as much like even in matchmaking casual whatever all that stuff and I feel like Mirage has taken its place and maybe that's the reason why why they didn't remove Mirage you know or also maybe they don't have plans for mirage at the moment you know they don't know what they're going to do with it so like just to remove it when they don't have a rework coming maybe that's also a reason you know but it is like all of it is surprising also like I'm sure a lot of people pointed it out that you know overpass was on the map that they literally built from the ground up they rebuilt it completely so it's not like they just ported it like in to the to the new version they literally built it from the ground up and then they remove it you know so I'm curious if that means that they rebuilt it so that they can just properly rework it but it feels like a lot of like wasted work almost like why do you rebuild it then then you have to rework it anyway maybe it's just because they wanted to wanted like the switch to CS2 you know they wanted to make it look as close to csgo so that the switch doesn't feel so uh so uh so significant you know like from CS go to CS2 it's hard to say like I don't see into evolves mine but that like if I had to guess that would be my that would be mine yeah nard just linked um I think I don't think we need to bring it up but um essentially what you mentioned before is that in in competitive in Premiere uh overpass was just not the most popular map like it was towards the towards the bottom actually it was surprising to me to see the Anubis is the least played from like a pug perspective this is data from from leify but it's kind of representative of the of the whole whole scene and it's such a huge difference from like the the pro scene and what people people play and and think about these Maps I think it's the combination of the two because it was the second oldest map like second longest in the map pool after Mirage and then also one of the least played ones from a from a casual side I think removing Mirage it would just be stupid I've been defending Mirage for like five years many people would leave the game many people would leave the game yeah I mean a lot of people how like how many times do you got like going to even face it or whatever and like Mir you play Mirage all the time man like it's impossible like unless you you ban it out like you just play it but I think it's not a good it's not a good thing that uh like the amount of the maps teams play on premere uh decides like which map going to stay in the map Pool think it's not a good the situation because wouldn't like Val of course Val thinks about like casual players first of all and that's why they move this like they remove overpass but my opinion it's not good uh situation for the future what do we think uh let's just talk about the map Pool uh overall and what it what it means because um from the pro from a pro perspective which teams are losing the most and which are winning the most with our pass for does too what do you what's the first complexity and pandis complexity losing overpass and I saw Le tweeting worst map pool ever because remember El had that his worst game ever on Dust two so maybe he had some etsd there I think he even said that or something like somebody replied to him and I think he reacted to that as well I forgot who did he play against I remember that but but uh it's kind of evaporated from my memory yeah but I mean the big one for like dust two would be big like that like the only people I saw like praising the dust two coming back was like one opers and second literally former and current members of big even Kito was like yes that's to his back he's not even in the team anymore you know he's just like welcoming the change so that's a big one I also think um the serbians they they always hated overpass like Nico Nexa Hunter now someone's going to say they start no can they B can they ban vertigo instead now and play Mirage I mean probably VP is struggling also because of the removal yeah but they also they also were good on Dust to I think originally I know it's different team so maybe that's not so bad for them um so that's yeah that would be another one yeah in Phase to sorry yeah I I think um I think G2 will be good on on the map I think we'll see maybe it's different now with hopsie in the team but it was always a pretty good Nico map I mean used to didn't G2 used to pick it like 247 like before hookie like in the Alexi days yeah they literally like that was their pick all the time and we were like why would you pick just two of all maps all the time like it's impossible to be consistent on it like big are the only team who made it consistent you know that is true I mean consistent as consistent as big can be to be honest uh but yeah that's uh that's pretty nice I think the VP angle like I'm actually pretty excited to see this team on on Dust two like I think electronic was always a beast on on Dust two Jame and like back from the avangard days like they had these these silly smokes that they brought out with like kicker and Buster era that was that was pretty sick and it's a lot of saving so um even though over passes out I feel like dust two is more more or less the same in in that regard like you're you're gonna end up saving quite a quite a bit still especially on on the CT side but uh let's talk about dust two a bit I'll just um you can do the screen share thing Lucas I'll just go through some smokes as we talk um because even though it's more or less the same app as it was before the some mechanics of CS2 coming in change how the map is going to be played and that's like opening Sky boxes all over the map so everything can be thrown everywhere and and the waterfalling of the smokes so essentially like throwing a smoke on something high and just having them come down like the CT Inferno smoke for example uh that's going to change quite a few things and also how much spread so like the I will uh just do the screen share right now and start with the CT smoke for example on on Dust do that is now one smoke and always used to be two smokes right so I'll uh I let it let's say Striker what do you what do you think about the meta on D two is it going to be CT or t- sided I mean the way I'm trying to remember like how it played at the end but I do remember that I didn't like it and that was also kind of like the same reason why I didn't like actually playing it myself in like matchmaking is because of how the block blocking off like the upper angle towards d double doors how much it puts CTS in a position where they can fight for middle and like as much as that is fun it also like completely hamstrung the te's where they Al always have to take long basically like if they have the spawns they will always take long and that's how the play map is going to play most of the time because mid is hard to contest sometimes you also have to contest for lower all the time so it's a bit like the map went from not a lot of like opportunity for CTS to to aggress to completely Li limiting the te's just to give CTS some opportunity to address to to aggress so it just I it felt towards the end of dust two from what I was remembering that it was just like a long control simulator you know like where T got more control instantly or they didn't get it and then they had a problem getting anywhere because you know they couldn't have middle as easily as they could previously they had to smoke off a lot of angles they had to flash off a lot of angles just I didn't like how it played and I expect that's how it's going to be played again can I mention one moment I just remember about D two we were playing at eepl against G2 with Alexi B and we were losing 147 s uh on last map to qualify for the playoffs okay and we did eight rounds Long so we we rushed long we did a retake slow and like some late round and we win the game so basically at the end of Cs it was just watching Team uh goes long fast or slow so it was always the same so it was kind of boring so I agree with you I am curious how much the how much CS2 will change it because I mean like as you say like it's just going to be easier to smoke long so it's even more towards the te's and I'm not sure that CTS really get the same kind of uh Advantage from that like what what can you even do with the new smokes or whatever like that that you can actually improve on like all the choke points are small anyway like all the smokes are going to be the same everything like that like that's just going to work the same way so I don't know I I just can't think of a way that it's going to significantly change in CS2 yeah I mean this is a nice screenshot that Nar sent over and it's a b a big discussion on on the Twitter sphere and that is that the spawns are like still completely random which they're not on most or all maps now um so I I feel like this is just an oversight um this this has to be fixed but at the same time just having this in at this point like why why is valve letting us down like this like this is obviously not supposed to happen I know why you sorry sorry you're good I feel like they're going to change the spawns cuz they change the spawns on all maps or most Maps like even Mirage they reduce the amount yeah and you know like with how it plays out right now seeing like like Hut said earlier going eight rounds in a row at long it's just so hard for CTS to contest long they have to spend like so much resources even up to four players sometimes yeah uh so do you think it's going to be like um more like a a further away from long the default spawns for uh for Te now yeah I think valve would probably mess with those spawns to give the CTS an edge and I think this map is going to be even way more sighted in CS2 and being part because of the mid door like he's in the meta in csgo they had their oper just posted up there waiting for rotations or they had somebody lurk behind that mid door waiting for rotations so yeah so so you think that's how does that help the the CTS or the t's I didn't no no T's T sorry T side it's going to be t- sided okay I mean but maybe M will change and they're going to play Passive on Long like and try to play on the other positions because it's there is if you have spawns like that M no point you will never get the information you need the first SP you need to run you need to flash smoke it's very hard like so if they keep this um spawns like that it's going to be very hard for I mean surely they don't remove all the long spawns I mean maybe they'll just keep a couple or something like so it doesn't happen that they just like te's have all all the long spawns or whatever like that but I don't know how they would remove all of them because then then CTS just have automatic control of long because you just never get there in time yeah before the best spawns for CTS do so it's like you can't remove all of them like because then just you will shift Dynamic to CTS even more uh I mean it was a t- sided map but it wasn't that like dramatic um I think um so yeah I don't know I don't know what they can do about this that that will make it more interesting you know at least yeah I mean honestly I don't think they care that much to be honest it's just uh not even to be like U negative or something but uh kind of the valve approach is to let it play and see in like two three months how how it should be adjusted so I guess that's probably why they didn't adjust the spawns they were just going to let it play out and see like does it make sense do we need people to be more people to be closer to long or not to be or to be further away but the problem is just that the randomness of it just makes it so I mean whatever is random is not really that skilled so that's that's the problem that dust to always had that the Reliance on spawns Lucas when you can you can just kill the kill the share um I like one thing that actually will change in CS2 is kind of like the smoke like we were talking about how it's enough for one smoke to cover all of long I wonder how many teams will do kind of like a double smoke anyway just to like layer them kind of so you can't just blow them up with one HP for example you know because that will also counter like what CTS will do now which is like wait for the timing when T's Cross or at least they think the t's are crossing you know just as the flesh is hit or something like that and then just pop a smoke you know and there's an OP literally like posted below b or or like in C pawn and just waiting for for the cross to happen you know so I'm curious about like the next step to that is going to be they will just put one smoke a little bit deeper one smoke a little bit behind it and there's no you can blow it up blow both of them up yeah shriker I I sent you a clip there Prof one team was already doing that oh okay cers yeah they threw the Deep CT smoke and then they threw the one AC cross smoke in yeah in case that gets broken so they still yeah that's that's absolutely like I understand why that why that happens it's exactly like just to remove like any CT possibility for um like to catch them off yeah I mean for for sure like it's it's going to add some new Dynamic to to dust two just the just the Nate smoke comp combinations and other like CS2 details it's not going to be it's it's going to be fairly interesting to watch just based on that because we constantly have like people updating their smokes adding new stuff to it uh a lot of the lineups that existed before are now not ideal because of the way the the smokes like spread there's some holes there's like the kind of like the the trick that quesera and uh and Fallen had with someone like shooting kind of the edge of the smoke and then the op posting I think a lot of that can be done still in mid doors to get info and stuff like that so uh it will be it will be fun but overall looking at the map Pool not bad not the worst not the best I feel like it was a nice time to add something new but at the same time cash from what I know is not ready and I think I honestly think cash would be horrible in CS2 like it's just a it's a smaller ancient they would be like very slow to play there's not enough there's just not not enough space on cash with the way people use utility these days to to play I I think that's my opinion at least uh but we'll see moving uh some any other thoughts on Dust two before we move on I don't think the backlash would have been crazy as it would be if it overpass wasn't removed I feel like if you know maybe vertigo was removed then we wouldn't hear like as much criticism as we have had about this map pool but in we see that M poool got way puger yeah it is interesting that you know like we were showing those stats from from leifi that vertigo was actually quite high up on the list in terms of played so I guess people just enjoy playing it more than they enjoy watching it which I mean kind of makes kind of makes sense to me but um I don't know maybe it's just died out a little bit like the hates towards towards vertigo and it's just become Rush that's like the the most hated map at the moment just because everybody plays it all the time I guess um yeah I mean I don't think anything new would have been um so I I wouldn't have expected that because we already just saw the last two maps that came in were both new right it was ancient and a ubis so I feel like if another new map came in maybe the map will be too new for like all the casuals as well to to to enjoy the game as I said you know Mirage has been such a staple that removing it in favor of especially a new map you know would have been um would have been pretty drastic you know then you would have like a a map Pool where vertigo uh Manis ancient are all in the map Pool um and then plus something new you know that we haven't seen you know so that that would have been maybe a little bit too much at the same time I saw also the there was a opinion that dust two is a very popular map in China and that's why it came back you know for in time for the Chinese major so maybe that's maybe that's a part of it but then again like where where is it just to popular like literally casually everywhere like everybody play D two anywhere you go yeah exactly like Russians love the map I'm sure yeah yeah um other than that I think we we kind of covered the the update there are some like smaller things that happened like the the change to the XM kill reward as well like kind of balances the gun out a bit which it is what it is I think it makes sense it kind of puts it in line with like a P90 of like a high um high damage SMG kind of weapon right SMG shotgun um but other than that just like quality of life stuff I think people are still waiting for more anti-che stuff and that is just a a part of the game that yeah as as was said on another podcast is my understanding as well is like that's that's valve's like main main priority in in terms of fixing it but it's also also from what I understand it's a very complex thing and it's not just you know people expect like oh there's an antiche and then there's a game and almost thinking of these two things as like separate but in reality the game the way the game is built includes anti-cheating measures right and and some of the stuff such as the you know in csgo after a certain distance or between certain walls you couldn't really see your your PC wouldn't even get the info that someone is there right and then something like this doesn't exist in CS2 so there's a lot of these small um not quality of life but quality of anti-che things that need to be added to to Source two in order to avoid you know some of the cheating but it does seem pretty pretty bad right now I don't know that that is just just a fact unfortunately yeah that's kind of said that's said like why why they doing this to us like I think that's not the question like they don't really care so much about like professional s how I see it like they everything they do is they care about the amount of the players are present in the game so same goes for the anti cheet We compare like uh Counter Strike to valerant it's a big difference because their an cheat is much better like and the how Riot responds to the problems in the game is much faster than so I think the only way to get it better like if all the community and like uh Pro players and uh influencers everybody who is in charge of Cs and just the players will continue uh highlighting csgo and saying mentioning the problems I think it's only way because we take like the normal day of the Cs no offense I love CS thank you very much but they don't really care so much like about the problems we talk about the really the only real problems like if people will stop playing the game and until they're playing the game they don't care so much about that so the only way to get it better not whining about it or saying like it's bad obviously it's not going to change we are the only one who are responsible to that and change it I think so yeah I mean I think I think you can also see it um in like the last few months that more or less everyone has has done something to highlight the problems in in in CS2 right now right so I think it's the community is actually doing quite a decent job for once I don't think I don't think you can actually fault them it's just about uh valve getting [ __ ] uh [ __ ] actually done realistically I feel like when you have when waral and three click Phillips are posting content about cheaters that's got to be a huge issue at this point I was I was actually thinking the same and I actually watched like a three clicks video or two today about like uh the anti-che and stuff like this and these are not the type of uh influencers that you know Farm the drama for you know everything that happens and in every opportunity uh to not name some other ones uh but if they are highlighting this then you know it is it is a problem on a massive scale for the for the average uh player and user but it is what it is um it is time though to do the skin Aire quiz are you guys ready to to fight for the for the people yes always skin we have five questions um the more you get right the better the skin and uh it will go out to someone in the chat and uh yeah do we have the link for the people Lucas before I announce the start yeah you should uh write trade it in chat to enter the raffle and we have the link so let's get ready for who Wants To Be A skiner About You by trade it GG question number one which of the following Maps was in the csgo and CS2 map Pool the longest was it cash nuke or train full Focus no comments it was either nuke or train yeah nuke or train obviously I answer in game or here like you can click on the thing if you want to lock in oh that I'll go sorry guys he locked in train I'm not sure about and uh correct answer is correct answer is nuke I think I never been good at this gam I want to say it was it would it would been a decent margin but that's just my my feeling like Nuke was only out for like a year for like a couple of Majors or something like not not that long but I'm not I yeah I don't remember exactly okay one down but let's uh let's see if he can make a comeback the the theme is uh the map pool after Mirage which was which map was the second most played map in CSO and CS2 with 24 th000 recorded matches on hltv was it dustu Inferno or overpass uh definitely not overpass so it's not Inferno n what do you think I think it's Inferno no go with this yeah boys anymore are you going to it's definely not over I'm going to get flamed okay I'm going to lock in Inferno and the answer is okay okay you're doing it's slight recovery slight recovery here guys going to question number three which map was played in the least number of matches across CS go and CS2 was it cash Cobblestone or train I love how he got train as potentially the most played and the least played map in the answers you hinting something or no no it's it's cash or Cobblestone Cobblestone yeah which map do you think I feel like Cobblestone play yes no I'm not sure yeah you get it right last time so I Believe In You jail we can go with we can go with cobblestone okay locking in [Music] Cobblestone another they correct go bad question number four before dust's reedition which map has been missing from the map pool for the longest Cobblestone dust two or train how can dust two before dust two what like which of them was missing yeah which one has has not been the map yeah oh it's not D two right can't be D two it could be it could be now um but it's it's not that long since it since it um like it's only been out for like a year or something Cobblestone right Cobblestone is missing since like 18 or and it's 2024 let's go Cobblestone I love this map locking in Cobblestone I think you must be right yeah yeah because like asral SI was on train as well like that was like one of their best Maps as well so it must be come back again and Cobblestone disappeared after like the Gambit major or something right yeah they are very good on G on Cobblestone and overpass yesh overpass everything yeah they they had like two streaks on I think it was like on overpassing Cobblestone okay final and the funny they pick Cobblestone and finally got stopped like three rounds against portals which map has 47 recorded matches on hltv just for I know it's easy it's easy it's season he's locking in season he's locking in season no confidence okay and the correct answer is I should have allowed you to change the change I was joking I was joking I never I never intended to change I was I was wondering if this was like including 1.6 or not because I'm like actually we played the no these uh the these stats don't have but that's what I was thinking like I was wondering was this G really played more than that no it's a source map it's a source map bro 100% because when we started playing it in 2014 and 15 in CS go we played finals against flip side on this map and one and one time I played some tournament with overdrive cookley SF and KY I guess on this map and overdrive scored more frags than cookley and SF combined that's when I started asking questions uh okay so my thought was like when was tuskan actually played like where was tuskan actually in the map po I mean uh like was it just like a bunch of show matches that they like overtook season or what happened no the question wasn't which one was played the least it was just which one was played 47 times ah okay okay okay so l l Bion 9 has won the won the skin uh congrats to you what does sponge would you say after this we'll send your people or your people talk to our people yeah yeah yeah that's a line he's a regular viewer let's go I mean he

the sound which is amazing it was very very confusing to me but props to you didn't know you were a ventriloquist on the side ventriloquist yeah or a team peist well that's the opposite that's the opposite this is uh this is still agel T confirmed still brought to you by Trad it and One X and uh this time we didn't say leading podcast like are we not not leading podcast anymore this news came in you know we we're being pressed hard pressed by uh by the other one by the other other podcasts uh honestly F podcast best best podcast the best anyway this is the question mibr beat Aurora but everyone's asking what happened uh is this game or my with you actually it's a classical story uh I think um I did a strategic mistake to join that team because obviously I didn't expect so hard and I'm not saying it's guys fault just uh I didn't like uh check out what's going to be in this team I think they are really talented players but we have a super different uh approach to the game how we see it the game and outside the game so we just didn't match at the wipe with some of the players and uh during the time like we had some normal results at the beginning but after really bad performance at RMR it was just a matter of time like that something happened so the thing is just didn't work out because we had a different views of how we should play and uh to be honest like um I I didn't do the job so good I I I feel like I could do it better and uh that's that's I take I take that personally because uh I am the only one who to blame uh as I have a big experience and uh I should have treated some moments differently so uh I take it is a good experience um don't have any bad feelings I'm really happy that they're doing good so right now and really happy that my uh assistant coach stopa brain who is now main coach and they're really satisfied with him so it's just a part of the game you know sometimes it just doesn't work out so nothing big yeah I mean they did change like three coaches in a year right so it seems like it's not uh not the easiest team to to be in not like justifying you I'm just looking at it from from an outsider point of view it seems like there's High demands in some sorts but uh they also changed a lot of players over that the same period so kind of yeah that is true like The Deco and res are there for whatever a month and a few months I don't remember but actually they change only one player uh like when I came to the team we had letic and we changed him for Deco and after that uh yeah results so we removed the Selter so it's only two players uh but yeah they had three coaches like obviously no none of them eded I think only one who was bringing some nice results was Statics um well it's a tough topic I think only time will tell who which side was right but as I have said like uh I don't have any bad feelings I mean like the how they run the team and uh how it works just like I have a different approach and that's it yeah but just looking at the results so now recently they um they won the B Dasa qualifier against some decent teams uh including b boom Apex Amal one win uh then they won the sky orts Masters which is online also b boom fors OG and now they played Challenger Melbourne they finished second wasn't really a stack tournament uh but they got to the final lost to mibr there what do you what do you think about the team do they have what is what is stopping them from kind of becoming a bit more consistent essentially because they've been around this like top 20 for about almost a year year and a half right I think they are super talented guys uh uh talent and just I mean like uh at some point if you want uh you can't have fun all the time when you play the game like sometimes you need to sacrifice some things in your life to become a better team so I think uh like recent results were really good online and online they played decent I mean like Challenger wasn't so stacked but MBR in my opinion is quite a good team but they also lost to aex which are not doing so good right now I mean they have a really good addition as a result I was asking uh before I uh we separated the ways I said that it's a good player that we should get him and I think he's one of the most talented prospects now on the S and he's very confident and uh has really good mechanics so I think maybe more changes maybe not I don't know like uh B buom data will be a really good tournament for them because last time we didn't qualify we lost to mibr in the final now they qualified and they have a first tier one event for a long time so I think it's that's the point when they will see that if they're doing the right job or not but obviously last um three months or two months were really good for them so yeah I mean and these are all guys that have played have been there and done done it like at least a couple of epls they've all played like some of the big events like across different teams like kenz and Norway was fours before right um resal as well and then lacky obviously with you guys with entropic was was a main stay at Big tournaments and all that stuff so there's some experience there yeah I mean overall that's all kind of I wanted to touch on regarding Melbourne because I don't know I don't know why this tournament existed to be honest like what is what is even the point with ESL having pro league at the same time they kind of just cannibalized their own tournament there's no one really wanted to play in it right or could play in it from the top teams look look at the teams which were playing like last time even had fly Quest I mean Renegades or something like this time uh two teams played the roster and the some mixed team not even like B King GRE news or something I don't know why I I heard um I read some uh Twitter they were saying that like why you putting the tournament on dates when we have a pro league so we can't it's stupid that's it yeah I mean it is part of like the the the F dream hack Festival that's going on someone is calling in the door okay but uh yeah as I said it was it is a part of like the dream hack Festival which is something that gets planned not only around the Counter-Strike um kind of circuit but still doesn't doesn't really make too much sense okay the next thing I have on the list but we don't have to take a lot of time for it I'm actually just curious if uh there's any like inside info here that that is not maybe known to the outer scene wonderful why f bed band not the na'vi wonderful do you know anything uh like I saw this guy was obviously there's two wonderful uh he played for some mixed teams then he played for AO he played for Laser Cats some some other teams I I I never like I saw him playing in some not decent like tier two or three teams in Ukraine like y maybe I'm not sure uh I have nothing to say like our scene is like full with the guys who are not fair I I haven't seen this guy cheating I never played against him and uh I can't say anything in particular about this case but uh fact that's it yeah I mean uh now what happened essentially is this is just a face it Ben and not a not a v b but uh the first na uh face it ranked player and first EU faed ranked player got banned which is not not the best uh not the best look for for anyone but at least I guess they're not winning when they when they're cheating with sad sad sad stuff uh but this is uh a more interesting topic um we did talk about Cloud a bit previous on the previous episodes but we kind of focused more on verus Pro and like what's going on with electronic now being there um Cloud9 now have three players uh four players depends on I guess guess how we how we look at it or boich aile Groove is there um they did what was the latest news obviously Hobbit and Perfecto benched for some reason not really fully explained or or clear and there are some news about using some people um I'm not really sure they pulled out the vpl because they don't really have a team so yeah but they're going to be DCH and two weeks so they have to do something yeah so what's the what's the general sentiment Striker let's start with just there I'm just [ __ ] confused like what's going on like I understand like okay I understand if electronic wants to go to a different team but like this kind of proves that there must have been some underlying issues there then that's why electronic decided to leave and maybe that just caused this Cascade um where just either the team is not happy with with the players or the players aren't happy with the team or both ways that's usually how these things happen but I'm just I don't understand how this team went from having some decent pieces to then then just sh deciding to bench himself to electronic just like splitting out of nowhere like just came as a shock to everybody and now they are just literally just have two players left I'm like who do you even take like that's going to be better than who they just benched I have to say like almost for for a year maybe even more like we've been actually struggling to even get Cloud9 interviews like at every event there's always this like um only if we go to playoffs we will do interviews and stuff like this so we didn't really have even access on a basic level obviously in interviews you don't really find out like if people hate each other in the team but you can get like some uh Vibes that are going on you know and so for the longest time we we kind of living with limited information and then these things that that happened I think out of all the teams and roster moves that happened like the shirro thing and now all of this kind of came out of nowhere and there's not even from the inside there's a lot of like in about why why anything's happening so who do do you have do you have any ideas uh regarding what's going to be the future for Cloud9 I mean or the or the past of Cloud9 like what's going on um past I think like in my opinion um when this team came with the shirro it was really good team like everyone expected this to be like na'vi number two and uh I think that when the sh Shir left it hurt everyone in the team really hard and um I mean like I feel like their expectations coming to this team were different I mean like thought like we're going to bring the navi VIP it's going to be good but yes changes so much like and you like names doesn't make you win the tournaments just just because you were good sometime I'm not saying they weren't putting ours or uh like trying their best I mean like the scene is really competitive now and um by the time they're losing the tournaments after they lost the Shir they lost the confidence and um I think it's not a good environment when you play in the team when you already know that someone's going to be removed soon or less like during my career whenever that happened it's just it was just a waste of time and when you play in the team and you know that you have aular up who going to play this role and you're going to change all the time so you expect someone to leave soon so I think this affected the team also really hard and I think that like um they just thought it's going to be an easy way but it doesn't work like that so I mean like I I can't say who was wrong I mean like all the expectations for the community were much higher uh than it appeared on the their last appearance on the tournament so I think it's just uh like wrong uh wrong team I mean like uh gr has his approach of how he looked at the game I mean Axel was used to playing with the guys like the with the band of the players who came from the lower rankings to the top and then the guys guys who won a lot of tournaments who like one of the best players who ever touched the game come to the team and you expect like everything to click but not about that like uh that's why we love Counter Strike it doesn't work like that and it's also like it like that change came just as CS2 hit so literally like they had like two events left like the big one you know that where we were like okay this cloud is going to dominate they had like two events left before CS2 came around and those two events even went badly so you're already behind as before you switch to CS2 then sh makes his decision out of nowhere you know it's like it is crazy how quickly that came undone like how quickly everything unfolded you know like okay I understand like if couple of events go badly like you had massive expectations couple events go badly okay you have to adjust their expectations now like it's not like we're just going to win events straight off the bat it's a new game blah blah blah but just like they never had the chance to try that even but to be honest I think they did their opportunity was to make a roster change and get an oper in December right yeah they they had to do it then um and everyone criticized them for what they were doing and they I guess they thought I don't want to say they thought they were smarter than everyone but they had a different uh vision of like what Counter-Strike can be and I think they kind of admitted it through some interviews and stuff like that there was the Finn the assistant coach I think his role is he spoke about it a bit thinking saying something like oh because CS2 was not really good for oper so like we thought we can play without an oper blah blah but I think what that only made the whole situation that ho was talking about kind of the lack of lack of belief and knowing that there's going to be a change sooner or later just made everything even even worse you know it doesn't really feel like a a thing that has a good foundation it just felt like a work in progress and of course someone like electronic or shirro that are great players and get great offers then they just want to go somewhere where things are a bit more settled I would say like I would understand that part but then why why do you remove or why did the two two more players just decide to go like I don't understand that how that results into that because like of course like after electronic leaves okay we don't have to care about who goes out of the team anymore we don't have to decide that electronic decid for us so now we just get an opera right but that's not what happened but it's like it's easy to say but maybe they're not the same the guys that played in uh na'vi before and they don't have this strong connection anymore like when the electronic left they might think like maybe this CH is thinkinking and it's time to leave because uh if we look at this team it was really great great team with different players and when na'vi players joined they tried to be good but the thing is uh it just didn't click so at this point when you're a player you think like maybe it's time to move on like if he left why should I stay or maybe I should I should look for another team another coach another players and at igil uh to be honest I I don't know what happened inside like I only can say my opinion and like I talk to some of the players but in my opin just um I don't know how to say it's in English but it's just like the wrong time you know it just didn't click uh because the circumstances were different they didn't have up they like didn't win the tournaments and they just felt it's time to leave and I think the biggest problem was Shir living there is this rumor that came about recently I don't know where it came from I know some people are asking in comments like uh Hooch to Cloud9 were you ever approached for this uh to be honest uh after Finn left Cloud9 I was asked by group uh to help him till the end of the season so now I'm consultating uh Cloud9 till the end of this I'm trying to help them to solve the problems so in like assistant coach roles kind of kind of like I can't say much but I think I'm just helping Constantine right now okay so so I guess the first step is uh finding players so that's uh that's a challenge challenge in itself okay so now uh now I'm gonna ask you why is Gro still on the team you can tell me what you think about his coaching G I'm sure you'll be very critical um it's hard to be critical at this point because Constantine is my really good friend and he was my first coach in my first igl and I have a huge respect for him so it it will be hard for me to judge him obviously if we talk about Esports or sports like the coach is always in charge of the the results like so I understand the frustration of the fans why he's still on the team but it's easy to judge when you watch from the outside and uh like uh there are some things that you can't control so I don't want to judge or protect someone I'm just saying like uh it's always easy to judge someone from the outside but when you see the situation inside it's much harder so can't answer this question you should ask this question uh Cloud9 GG mail something like that I wish man like it's impossible to get a hold of or like try to figure out anything about that team it's like you want to talk to anybody like it's like it doesn't like no contact exists like you try to ask somebody like you see Jack like tweets one thing or like not tweets like puts on Reddit one thing and it's like that's pretty much the only thing that we ever heard from the team ever I was m i was met at Boom at last uh major they lost and I say like he came to the interview and he said some words to English broadcast and I say like maybe you come to say something to Russian broadcast people cheer for you and stuff explain what happened like and no one wanted to do so and for me like where this point now in the Esports is growing every day and you should take responsibilities and like of course we don't have these fans who come like in football they pay travel and stuff but still we need information obvious like and uh that's something everybody need to work on but I can't judge the players after losing the tournament it's always hard but I always respect with the guy or igl or one of the players come and says guys we've U I don't know how say [ __ ] up yeah I can say that okay we [ __ ] our pants blah blah blah like sorry next time we're going to be stronger it's just my humble opinion and I think like should be more open of course like there is some in things that should never open for the whole Community but I think U it would be M much less stressful uh for the players and for the management if they would be more open like people would see like we're they're humans we're losing we're not satisfied with that we're disappointed sorry blah blah blah I think it would be better in my opinion but I'm not the one who judge so I mean especially like now if you're Groove you know like you're the guy who should take some sort of responsibility for this like even if it doesn't necessarily mean like it's my fault or whatever but like okay this is what happened maybe I mishandled something whatever like whatever it is and try to at least make the community understand in some way because like at the moment we're just getting zero like zero information anything like even behind the scenes there's like conflicting things about whose decision it was like how much of it was Mutual how much of it was was the coaching staff like deciding the um the the move like some of it like some of the players to leave you know no one wants re you know because like when you put it up to the media it can explode like we were satisfied with him or so reply and then they reply and it goes like a i doesn't have to be it doesn't have to be a blame game right but it's it but at least like give us something you know like at least some sort of an understanding like okay like what you said you know like I understand that it's kind of a cliche like we didn't click or things like that but of course like that's always a part of it like we just saw the game differently we just don't know we just know how to make it work without an oper all that stuff like you could have picked a million things that like everybody knows was a problem and you could at least in some way explain why but it's just nothing you know that's I'll tell you they they they think in a way like it's easier not to say something so there is no problem I it's easy way but I don't admire it I understand the mentality I don't I obviously don't agree with it that especially like me as a me as a journalist you know I'd rather have people talk about whatever is going on and especially at least on some level ha just like this stonewalling it also leads to a lot of speculations and like fake info and like because like when people say nothing then what happens there's like 7,000 CS podcasts and like stuff and broadcast moments where people are just gonna say stuff that they think is true and then people are going to take this as gospel and take it over and and it's also like when you also hear something like okay like one guy hear something from one side you know but he never checks with the other side you know so he will like kind of portray his opinion as something that like or like portray something he said he heard from the player as his opinion and then like people believe that they're like I heard this you know and people would think like okay that's an informed opinion we can believe that you know but we never heard the other side of the story and then another expert who talks to the management whatever says okay but I heard this and then you're like what the so what the [ __ ] is the truth um I mean here's a comment from Wick Po in the chat he says the day comma comma when they removed inters comma comma I stopped carrying comma comma I was fan of this game with roster not Cloud9 but to be honest just just to put this whole whole situation perspective because Cloud9 signed this team not that long ago it was like uh 20 which year was it 2012 Rio major uh so before that like middle of 20 20 2022 right um and realistically they came in and they for Cloud9 as an or I think over all it's still a pretty good job they came out of kind of obscurity of Counter-Strike they didn't exist in Counter-Strike for some time and the light light all of the teams almost since the Boston team were kind of [ __ ] so like from 2018 they didn't have a good team yeah in Counter Strike they came in they um got this team and they won Dallas they got to the real major they had like a good playoffs run there I think that that first part great then they remove inters which is I think like people did take like oh this is not a good move but I think the the worst part was who they signed I think the signing of Buster was not the solution and it proved to not be the solution it was not even the the role or the or the quality of player or the form or anything that they that they needed so that's like I would say first misstep then the kind of things go start going down um then the big transfer K comes in when they sign uh electronic in Perfecto obviously huge signings no one can say like this is bad business even after everything that went down you can't say this was bad like it just you had to try it if it became available you could say putting electronic as the igl was the wrong move because he didn't really prove himself in the role but at the same time he was he was pushing to be that like he was IG Ling in na'vi at the time I I I I didn't like it from the start and um essentially at the moment when electronic doesn't want to igl anymore from that point onward the team is going down significantly right and even with him igiling he wasn't in great form so that wasn't good either but but that's when they needed to make like a radical change and find a solution but then it took them like four or five months to get boage and then when they got boage they lost you know they lost shirro and then it took them six seven months and now they still don't have an oper I think when you look at oh there's something bad in Cloud9 but what is bad they changed so many players I think you have to point towards Groove and be like this is you're doing right he you are managing the team he is the from my understanding in Cloud9 the person that kind of controls the whole division right obviously Jack has say and he can't just like go out and buy players not like he has a infinite cash check but like he he is the person making the the most of these like informed counter- strike decisions so I think it is a very like a significant stain on on his um his decision making but at the same time just financially I don't think Cloud9 are too dissatisfied because as I said they got the team super cheap if you compare them to like at TSM or some of these other Orcs that try to get into Counter Strike like bleed or something like that it it it takes so long to get to a competitive level they started instantly and they have been up there qualifying for almost every major getting the prize money they had that one hiccup for for Paris right when they didn't qualify when they lost the phase in the last chance but overall they have been financially a really good investment I think for for cloud Cloud9 and that's why I think it makes sense that Groove still has a spot because he probably has been delivering on what what Cloud9 need from him as as a baseline I mean I don't know like I can't speak to to Cloud 's decisions it's more like but let's go with the topic like for example removing interest and changing it for Buster yeah mhm not the obvious like the the decision of removing uh interest was just a matter of time obviously who they pick uh booster was really like kind of good in VP he was doing really good but he didn't in this team at all and after that getting electronic at perfecta was a really good move and I think like the problem that timing that electronic decided to be a ja instead of bringing igl at that point they tried to spend five six months getting him as igl and this like this I think maybe it's a mistake because uh obviously now he doesn't want to be igl and like a lot of players take this sacrifice like the moment they feel I want to be igl but when the reality comes it's much different because when you're just playing uh do a lot of job but when you're IG and Captain you need to be doing like 25 times more and that's why like he understood like it's it's not his same I think same happened with MX in uh liquid so I think it's just um yeah it's always like the management who is responsible so I I can't judge on this point I mean like we all expected Cloud9 to be a better team obviously and and I hope they're going to be a one yeah that's my opinion I wonder how much of it also had to do with kind of like let's say electronic decision to leave you know as like I don't see an oper that we can get that I'm going to be happy with you know because obviously a big Target would have been Mony but the it's pretty clear that he would he's not GNA leave G2 anytime soon at least so if you can't get Monas you can't get like your primary target and who like what other options do you have there are a lot of operas from the region that could theoretically be at least you know but it's not like a big it's not going to be a big name that they're going to get that's proven in CS2 that it's going to be like their the solution to the problem okay go ahead uh if we talk about Ops now uh in C or world yes Mony is delivering like one of the best players in the world right now no doubt but tell me who is really good with OP right now I mean that's kind of my point yeah not in like in the world say and C yes we have we have talents we have talents like just a matter of time when they will show will shine I mean like they're already on the scene already played majors and stuff I mean like our region is stucked with The Talented players and Ops in particular I mean like there shouldn't be a question if we can get a good oper because can we get a good oper as Mony no you can't not possible in any team right now yeah if you have all money in the world real basic like the next the next one would have been like unless you look at some like some people like shy or something like that that then you have like art Frost who is also kind of like somebody we think is going to get there at some point but he's also not proven in tier one like we haven't seen him play for like uh I mean we have seen him play in spirit obviously but like not one a very consistent level so we don't know if he can if he has what it takes to be on tier one you know so it's like all of any move you make right now is going to be a risk and it's obviously not going to be the same kind of stature of a player that everybody else on Cloud9 was so I wonder if that was like the first thought that kind of like started this this this Cascade you know we're just not going to get an oper that is going to be great we we just have to settle you know and then from there you realize okay so maybe VP is a better home for me right now you know because there's Jame we have a lot like they have a lot of proven um like they have a proven track record I can make them better I can finally be the guy who brings them to titles you know so I wonder if that's like the electronics uh kind of point of view first of all yeah one of the things probably it was yes is like of a good op and getting any player now it's a risk but the thing is like it's always like that you like you buy you buy mody now it's not risk but what oper you buy now it's not risk no maybe broy okay bro that's it I mean I I don't know watching I was watching some some Phase game and the he is the I don't know how to describe this he's he's the best player that can win that can lose you the worst rounds yeah I know how else to say it and also win obviously he can win also insane rounds but he can also lose them which is absolutely insane I'm a huge fan I don't care sorry like everybody says bro is not stable he's random he do a lot of mistakes I don't care I watch games he delivers that's it sorry dude just watches the highlights he only watches when he frags on YouTube like no I mean but yeah it's uh what will Cloud9 do I don't think we need to go too much into that because uh obviously ho can't tell us anything I can I cannot unfortunately but when they when they do we'll bring you back on to explain why with a pleasure yeah why you signed artrust unless gr tells you like you can't say anything because even they haven't said anything this whole time no no I I I wanted to say something but I can't so yeah but obviously there is a lot of talent seriously like I I was looking for for the players we have players we have we have no I mean like not Cloud I mean like how big is the list is the list like this or like this like this like my your po po yeah PO for off topic um okay what do we have okay we need we it's time to talk about uh EPL uh but before we go into EPL itself we'll start with our new segment what are the odds what are the odds presented by WX bet this is a a new feature on the show we'll break it down slowly but essentially um we here the panelists will have a question in front of us and we'll try to gauge How likely something is to happen uh and then we'll put it later on the vote on the social medias and people will vote if they think yes or no and based on what we How likely or unlikely it is and what you guys vote there will be a big prize purse for the end of the season that we will give away so essentially uh you're kind of kind of guessing we're kind of like a bookie in a way uh but with zero zero investment from your side so Lucas is sending me some [ __ ] of course what do I do okay who are you what why is this whole thing okay who Am I who am I did you guys send got this thing can you click it I should I click it as well okay dude is sending me a million things I'm I'm sorry for not having the smoothest uh hosting role today my chair is breaking my the world is dying the animals are leaving but the question for today WX bet what are the odds is what are the odds Falcons make big event playoffs before the break and this is including Dallas and bbom Dasa I don't know if bbom daa is a big event or not but let's say it is just for the for the sake of this um and now the three of us will gauge it from 1% to 100% How likely is it that Falcons make a big event playoffs before the break I announce it or just you can announce it then you can press it okay so uh actually I'm really disappointed like I watched a lot of the games of Falcons on major qualifier and last tournament and like of course they had Boris who made a lot of mistakes blah blah blah but I never saw so many stupid mistakes from such experienced players I mean like how they play in advantage and situation they lost so I feel like something going wrong with that team and I always I was always a big fan of zic and also I respect all the players on the team huge fan but like was strange feeling uh watch this kind of players with their experience making such stupid mistakes so I feel like something wrong with the team but for me it's not an excuse if uh your uh young player like he make mistakes M of course of course of course okay yes that makes sense that happened yes no doubt but like can't make mistakes because of him changing his mouth so I feel like the atmosphere is part there even though I watch their um Vlogs and uh I like the approach but if for me like they have everything money like good coach and stuff this uh management but something is wrong I don't know so I I think it's 20% they make playoffs and this but I hope they're going to get better because I'm huge fan of zonic for me I put them a little bit higher just because I think daa has a reasonable chance just because of the teams are there um like let's say like Falcons are the fifth highest team there and if you look above them there's just like heroic who have also been kind of on the downwards um tendency I still don't think they will um just because of how bad they looked during during EPL it looked pretty rough um and I was like I was watching them through it and I was like we were going into it thinking like they were talking about needing like a star rifle to build build around right and then Dupri ends the tournament as their highest rated player I'm like I did not see that that part coming you know but it's just it just feels like it's especially from Snappy's point of view it has to be a lot about confidence and that's just something that's super hard to gauge because like you just can never know until you kind of talk to the people but I think it's just spired to a degree where Snappy probably doesn't believe in what he's doing like he's kind of con probably constantly second guessing what he's doing and then he has to focus on how badly he's playing because like his individual level has been horrible like he went from like one of the best fragging in game 1 Point not 1.6 in CS:GO I don't know how I how how I got to that for um then csgo to basically the worst in CS2 at the moment and that's I refuse to believe that that's just because the game is different and that's just because uh that's just be because he's suddenly a bad player I think it's because of the change of the team and and how much he's probably has a lot to think about at the same time and like unless you start winning it's hard to get out of that rut you know but then you kind of have to get out of the rout to start winning so it's it feels like kind of a a like a repeat um on constant you know so um I think in data it's pretty reasonable like whatever 45 I would say percent maybe 40% but it's less than that in Dallas which is why I went like 33% uh sorry you were talking about Snappy not delivering like he used to yeah all right but I remember on RMR he played really good he against Amal he was the only one who was playing yeah that's that's fair but I mean he had like that maybe it might be like the one game that he played well well maybe one maybe two I don't know I'm just saying I'm looking at the stats there and it's like literally the only game that he went in the in the green you know for example and it's like uh maybe it was ancient I just remember he was crashing them but they couldn't do anything like I mean uh it's always like now igl should frag it's a big topic it's all the time we say that they should frag obviously and they should frag but I think it's not about Snappy or Boris before like I mean like something just doesn't work in the team but I hope they're going to get better but doesn't look but they had depr very good player very good player I'm I just don't I really don't understand I spoke to several people and nobody really gave me an answer about why de PRI like people behind the scenes like I I asked some um some players some some coaches some some people from like management GMS whatever nobody could really come up with an answer like why dpri of all people like wise this doesn't necessarily fit doesn't fit in terms of um age because like okay even if you perform now it there's a timer on this lineup like they're what 28 28 on average or even more than that 28.4 like obviously this lineup is not going to survive long term just because of how old it is like it's just statistically that doesn't happen that way you know maybe you're going to be the one in one in a thousand that's going to make it work but usually that's not how it how it goes you know so I I just don't understand this that move and how That was supposed to fix this team you know like I even from before they they got into pre the way that they were talking about like who they need obviously not der PRI they're not going to build around der PRI as like their biggest star that's never going to happen then Snappy says maybe they're going to do it by committee or or what whatever the the word he was using um and like of course that can work but just for some time right like it's it's it's going to be only a matter of time before some of these players start to fall off and we maybe even see it with some of these these players that just not fitting in CS2 as much as they were before so I just don't get I don't get the future of this team even if it works starts working now suddenly like I don't know where it goes I have a question do you remember when depri was removed from Vitality who was that was a call from the organization not from zic right I mean zic took the blame for himself I think it was kind of both I think it was a combination there I mean from what from what both of them said and from what I what I heard behind the scenes was kind of that's Vitality were like pushing forward but then also zic like understood why I I have a pretty delusional take but if you might I will say I we love to okay so the thing is I they managed the team and they lost qualifiers for major and they thought that like it's the lack of experience and maturity from the borers so we need someone who can fit the roles and like like you know close the gaps and stuff uh and they didn't see obvious candidates to bring it right now even though they have a lot of money they they didn't know who to pick and and to be honest like the season is going on not so many players from the tier one would rather move to Falcons if they didn't move before when they had this opportunity why opportunity why they should do it now of course Money Changes a lot but uh playing in a top team getting good salary and like just essentially what you're saying they can't get Nico now but maybe they can get Nico in January maybe maybe maybe but I don't know like the thing is they they said like let's finish this season with dpri he will do what he supped to do and after that bring the wallet yeah I mean if you have look if you have unlimited money as we kind of suspect that Falin do um that is obviously like a way to do it you know like okay this lineup doesn't have a future one year down the line but who's to say we're going to keep even four of these players in one year down the line even three of these players you know like this team is clearly like willing to spend the money if they can get the players that they want um and they have tried at least and it just didn't work with like people like Nico Mony um whatever you know so maybe that is the that is the deal you know they just threw some money at Dei for now and said like okay maybe in three months this is not going to continue but like for now let's see if let's see if this is a way where we can improve short term at least you know so I could see that being the angle I just don't understand it in the first place like it almost feels like all we compensating for what the problem is with for us which was whatever immaturity like not making the right decisions in game like just being very inexperienced a little bit too gung-ho you know like into situations all that stuff you know that happened like and then you go for ex the absolute extreme opposite you know like the the the guy who has like all the experience most major wins all that stuff you know but uh is obviously also on the older side you know so I don't I it feels like an overcompensation uh I mean I don't think it's that delusional of a take I thought you were going to say something like zic kicked so he wants to bring him back to make up for it that would be kind of like a delusional take I would say but what you said I think makes a lot of sense actually like that that does does feel how it how it went down they they are kind of buying time time until there's a better opportunity and I do think they even mentioned not mentioned but the signing is like until the end of the year something like that right Striker I actually was going to check if they said anything about it not longterm contract but uh just for a second I just to bring it back to to what are the odds uh Lucas can you can you bring up the the odds thing um I think it was 3.85 yeah I remembered so we give it 26% which converts to uh 3.85 odds um after the show uh we'll have a poll on Twitter people can say yes or no and then based on that we'll write it down and add like 50 times whatever the the odds are for for the correct answer right if you get if the fans get the correct answer and uh so we expect like at the end of the season to have like a few thousand uh maybe Euros give away with skins and stuff powered by powered by oneith I actually went back to the statement because I just needed it needed to check how exactly it how exactly it was worded and it says our journey with him begins now with plans until 2025 and an open approach to adapt if needed with the flexibility of mutual determination if the expectations are unmet so yeah I mean basically like in a way what uh what we were talking about here kind of like just see how it goes for now and if it doesn't work we'll go another way by the way talking about transparency uh what do you think about uh Falcon's Vlogs and this case with Boris we were talking about Cloud night not bringing anything to the community and now we have this what do you think I think um I mean Snappy said it well but then again like Falcons probably should have understood it that you know whenever you bring something like that you're never going to be able to to put in the full context and the problem was that that part of it like so much was focused on that part of it that like that's of course fans that's all fans are going to think about like why is everybody harping on this one small problem about this guy you know like five people just gang up on one guy because they spent whatever what was five minutes of the Vlog 10 minutes of the Vlog basically talking about this month's Mouse issue you know in the original version or whatever so like you know it was it seemed like a little bit of an oversight of like what the reaction was going to be to that and uh um um I didn't mind it like a little bit more of a look and I think people did overreact a little bit and like as if you know this doesn't happen in every team you know some sort of like blame games or whatever somebody [ __ ] up and then like people let him know this was obviously an extreme version of it and like for for you to show all of it you know like I would understand like okay if they leave the Sonic part and like okay I'm gonna point my finger at you you [ __ ] up you changed the mouse you shouldn't have done that you played cut of it ends there nobody says anything nobody says anything about that because it ends there you leave that issue with that you don't have to show five like all the four other players telling him the exact same thing Z just told him and it's like he just obviously feels shitty about it you know it's just and of course like that's that's uh that's just feels like a poor Ting on their part I think I think also what the the the context that Snappy added u in the recent interview that we had with him was like it wasn't just that he changed the mouse and played bad but that during the whole game he was constantly complaining how he's the mouse is [ __ ] I can't kill anything blah blah blah like doing this things on teams speake during the game which then of course is going to annoy you even though like as you say who like you're playing with a new player he's going to do stupid [ __ ] that's just how how it goes right but uh it is it makes it definitely worse if he's making these decisions and then also like complaining and bring this bring this negative energy and just like annoyance right to to to everyone in the team like just distracts from what is important in the game right I feels the fr of the players because like they were expected to come to win the tournaments and like you hear magic saying like really important things but when you come to reality it's much harder like and then this thing like and I'm pretty sure they will bounce back talking about Mages or uh zic I mean it's always hard for the guys who were on top to throw down and like you come to the team and you expect the things to be the same or even a better way and when you realized that it's going the wrong way it's uh really hard to stay strong mentally and I and I felt like they like the confidence they had before obviously the team that played in ants and the guys who played in Vitality they were super confident at some point some of the players just loow that confidence and in this moment you always find the easiest way to find the excuse you know and I don't think it's was a purpose to show that like it's the only victim but it felt like for the community that we lost because Boris did those things so I think it's it's good way to show the transparency of the team but in this specific way it was like the only why who was uh who was to blame yeah there's actually a decent question from uh sky full of people on uh on the in the chat says how but why did Monty sdy know how to handle boros successfully and and if you ask me I think it's just different expectations um from a team like Monty and the players that are in Monty um that you first of all you know you can't have Nico which Falcons all the players that were there maybe not all of them but the most of them were maybe expecting Nico to be in this team and then you mentally go from like here to here at least in terms of like experience and Prof professionalism right and when you're on Monty you're like this guy is awful to play with with like he's doing so many stupid things but he's also very skilled and he is so skilled he's going to win us some games but he's also going to lose us some games and this is the best that we can have so I think it's very much easier to come to terms and kind of balance that out versus when you're on a team like Falcons which has like winners or I think Snappy I would say yeah he won some tournaments but he's also in a point of his career where he doesn't want to lose time uh uh he doesn't want to [ __ ] around he wants to go and and win so I think all of them would just have such a harder time to deal with something like this right obviously you know there's going to be younger talents that need to learn but there's younger talents Al Mony and Don where are still going to make mistakes right but they're going to deal they're going to learn faster so you can you can just accommodate it rather than be frustrated right yeah I think that's a big part of it for sure and it's also like uh also because of the whole performance setup about Falcons like everything is about building some consistency right everything's like about building a performance model and just like sticking to it over a long period of time so that it finally pays off at the end and then halfway through it like not even halfway through it like through it you see this guy who's like completely inconsistent about anything that he does in the either in the game well in the game not so much with Falcons actually like he was not necessarily in the same positions as he was in Monte but just from the immature side of it and all that stuff like suddenly there's one guy that sticks out right everybody else has this kind of vision of like okay we have to follow this model and we we have to be consistent about it and then it will pay off and then this guy just changes changes MS between tournaments before a match or whatever and that obviously creates a massive hitch in his consistency and like if he's not dealing with it as a professional then on top of that then that's a problem and it's not like you know he's he wouldn't be the first one to change mice before matches like between matches or whatever like that but players change M mouses in matches during matches like flam did before yeah yeah yeah so it's not it's not like that specifically it's like the only issue but like if it compounds into a lot of different things that just um and he's obviously a lot younger than the rest of the team you know so culturally as well completely different so from all these perspectives you know he just doesn't fit everything about him just sticks out and so like of course he's going to be the channel like that that just like everybody takes it out on um talking about mon like I I was watching their games when they in Paris and stuff and talking to the players and Co I feel like uh forest was free to do whatever he wants like they had a structure obviously but in this structure he could do whatever he want so I just remember some matches when we lost the eepl qualifier to against Monte when he was scoring 30 frags and stuff so I see it like that uh he's a very good individual player like if you talk about pck style when you do on your own and at some point it works at some level it works but when you go to the higher level ever people get used to it and uh just don't play so good as you used because people expect you to do the things also when you become a uh like notable player when you you were struggling like struggling you were playing in the point like sammar no one ever heard like how good you are and then everyone's saying borish borish borish borish so at that point he thinks like I'm the top of the world I'm the best player like I can do whatever I want and then he got the invite for Falcons and this point you have a huge salary huge salary everyone talks about you how good you are and when you are young and you have a lot of you know like um uh things like how to say uh in Russia we say we have a common word it's called you have to pass like water fire and um I don't know how to say in English it's called M TR so it's basically means that you need to stay the same person as used to be when you have the uh fame money and stuff yeah so it's very hard because you have a lot of friends a lot of beaches and stuff like that coming to your life and uh which distract you from things you are good at and when you come to a team with a structure when the five time winning maor guy who understands how it works when everyone need to know what to do in the certain situation and then the guy who who was told before like you should go yard and kill and now he he says you should go yard and kill but if you see this you need to do this and at some point he was like like what I what what I'm supposed to do and maybe he wasn't ready for this structure because it's like in football you can you can buy a guy who was really good for example in like some mediocre team like and then he comes to Barcelona and Real but he can't do the same things he do he did before some of the big talents will come and do the same and then they become the greatest ones but the the problem is when you are good at some team in the lower level and you come to a better team you need to adjust and become a better person a better player and that's what happened with him that he couldn't just like handle it and also he said some controversial thing which I didn't like when he called out nbk on some broadcast or broadcast or some interview and he said he didn't have a proper a jail you shouldn't say things like that you should respect the guy you played with and should be respectful to your teammates and the up to you to believe in karma or not it's like we can talk about it all day and night but I think like you should prove yourself with your game not your not the words and that's it yeah so I just Googled the uh the saying or the whatever idom that that you mentioned so um it says uh you have to go through fire water and Brass trumpets so like fire and water are like challenges like different challenges and the trumpets are like the praise you know that you get from other people and uh saying like the the praise is the hardest thing because that gets to your head right and the other things are just kind of physical kind of kind of cool um we had Blade with some uh some like um smart words last time uh now we have some some new new learning new things every time um I think this is uh end of the end of the Falcon stuff like we could talk about them for forever but there's a few other teams that we should talk about so I I'll just note a few and you guys can tell me what you're most excited to talk about so we can talk about uh australes and building a bit of momentum we have Mony uh and G too and I would maybe like to talk about Mony and donk and some of the things that people have been saying about that we have a first look at verus Pro um and we also maybe could talk about a bit about yakar and and liquid because obviously hooi kind of I don't want to say discovered him but you played with him like in his developmental years and stuff like that so what what are you guys feeling the most from these I I in a good company I can talk whatever I want bring up the topic try okay I me I mean I don't think we need to spend so much on Asis I think it was kind of like a lot of the same good things that we were already talking about like during changu and where where they were showing that I think is this was just more of the same I mean stown just looking great back in his old roles um and actually I mean even from a leading perspective it seems like everything's working well like they're making the right calls at the right times it doesn't seem like there's any issues I don't know how much of it is like by committee you know how much like device was doing a lot of Praise of St and how much he has how much input he has how much he understands macro so it seems like just that combination is working really well uh I I don't know I I have nothing bad to say about as stral at all they just Bree through this group even playing phas in other time so um yeah great stuff yeah I'll I'll just uh hop on asres on hltv and look at their last matches so since they essentially put this team together uh they beat steel helmet obviously not a great win but whatever they beat phase 20 and changu then is Pro 20 and then they lost the phase one2 um in the in the playoffs and now at EPL they beat Eternal fire to beat phase to and then 3D Max 20 so pretty strong run of form most like all of these games that they won were not on on stage or anything but it's it's looking pretty good it's looking as good as it can look like obviously they could have gone one shangu but I don't think that's like super realistic but for for for a new team this is uh even if it is honeymoon phase I think it's uh it's proving to be really good the the roles kind of work out they managed to find a balance of that with bro I think that's that was always super crucial because the last lineup lacked lacked these clearly defined roles and it also shows that you know too many cooks in the kitchen how detrimental that that can be y yeah I also like how much St is still kind of keeping up the same level that we saw like when it wasn't the dysfunctional astris like he's still performing really well in the same roles and that's that's something that I like uh um a lot because I wasn't sure if I was if I would expect that you know once this as starts working I would expect him to just kind of like slow back into like the an anchor roll and just do whatever like um kind of unimpressive um you just don't don't notice these guys a lot unless they are really good and he seems to be really good on in those obviously you're going to look a little bit better when the rest of the team around you is also good but he looked better when the rest of the team wasn't and now he keeps doing that so I think that's also Des deserves a little bit of a nod yeah um ho let's let's just jump on to onto verus Pro um what have you what have you seen from uh from the new verus Pro with uh with electronic I haven't seen much to be honest I only watched one match uh everyone is really hyped about them and expecting them to be one of the best teams in the world I personally think it's going to be a hard task for them uh because uh there is no doubt that the electronic is super player great experience great skills and stuff but the thing is his vision of the game much from the they had before so now probably they're going to switch uh approach because um uh many guys mentioned that like this style doesn't work PS2 like it worked in CS go I think it's not about like talking about style I mean they they felt like they're running out of ideas at some point some teams started just playing better than them and like I think that lost against G2 on major was very hard for them so they so it's just we need bring electronic but I think they can be become one of the best team in the world but it's going to be a really hard uh task first of all for electronic because uh like at some point you losing confidence uh when you're super good at na'vi then you come to Cloud9 he was playing but they didn't succeed so much and now he moved to vtus Pro we don't know the reasons behind it but on the paper it's it sounds really good but I think it's going to be really hard for them um I hope they're going to fix it but I think it's going to be not so easy from the beginning uh so far they played uh pretty confident against some teams like so but I don't think it's the measure the really capacity of yeah I was going to say the exact same thing you know like from The Phase game I did watch that one and they looked completely out of sorts like they just didn't really have any answers at all um and obviously you know some teams will just looked that way against phas but it just looked even from the first game that um BB played against SCT like that was that took me off guard I didn't expect them to lose that one um and but I understood it why because I saw them go for like these super fast plays like towards the beginning of ancient for example that just didn't make any sense they were just like power rushing through a smoke you know without any sort of setup and it seemed like were they were just changing things for the sake of changing things like changing up the pace and trying to take the other team off guard without actually having any basis for it and it just seemed like everything seemed a little bit brute forced and I'm sure that's partly to do with just they didn't have enough time to play with electronic and just actually buildt some sort of a foundation with what his ideas of the game are and what the rest of the teams are but just some of these some of these moves that they were making I really didn't like it just seemed like they were kind of pugging part parts of of the maps that they played take a lot of time it will take a lot of time because you can't start like play like if you take about football if you play defensive football all the time you can't start like just playing offensive just because you want to because you just bought to one guy who is good at scoring goals so same goes for CS like uh obviously we we shouldn't uh think about this tournament because it doesn't show anything I mean like it will take a out of time because maybe they're tired of playing this passive Counter Strike and like playing on the team's mistake they want to take the leading role now but it's not easy to change your perspective the game identity completely identity yeah it's it's a good word thank you very much you can't change your identity so fast and it will take time and uh it can happen but it will take time it it it's the most important thing like how they will uh treat themselves and their teammates during this hard period because as I said it's a big challenge for electronic now like because he need to understand like he need to bring something to the team and to listen from them and if someone will take the lead won't work good so they need to find the balance and if they will find this balance they will be really good yeah I mean versus Pro run just to also recap that uh started with a loss to fanatic which sent them into a lore bracket then they beat saw um then they lost to faze and then they beat fanatic like a rematch and then they beat saw again so they made playoffs and they beat saw twice and ftic that's yeah it's not that crazy impressive they got kind of banged out by phas as well so it's like the time that they did play against the recent team it looked pretty rough uh but yeah I think I think what you're saying which makes a lot of sense so you're giving them like when do you think they are going to be competitive for titles because I think this this lineup should compete for titles that's that's the bar where the bar is now right but when do you think that is realistic um if it comes together obviously I think Shanghai probably like U talking about this matches so is a good team like not the best not like tier one obviously but yeah because I just I just checked another groups on and they have a quite good group if we talk like ftic and so not the best but not the worst talking about uh winning uh titles yes obviously they this this move was suppos to to get get them to the titles I think they need at least two three months at least and we should like fans should understand that it's really hard because they're changing their style but if it going to click and they will fit in this style it's going to be good it's going to be hard to for them to catch up now though like they have a lot of officials to start so they're they're not going to have a lot of time to practice like because they play u they're playing in the playoffs of pro league so they're playing all all the way through to the end then there's Dutch then they have the um CCT Global finals to play I mean that's online but still like that's that's a week that you kind of have to play a lot of official instead of practice straight into Dallas straight into spring final you know maybe with like a couple of weeks in between all of this you know so like it feels like it it will be unless they somehow jump on a train then they start winning and you know they just carry the momentum towards the end of the season it feels like it will be only after you know the the player break that we will start seeing some like actual change in this team yeah I I do think like they're I expect their approach to be like kind of experimental for this part and then probably like a bit of a break and then hardcore like figuring out what the identity is and how they want to play I I when you when you talk about these like super fast-paced round to start the tournament like it's or the to play against FaZe I do feel like they they might be I I don't want to say snowballing but like they want to also throw in completely different stuff and they don't really or they shouldn't care about eepl like obviously everyone wants to win every tournament but they've been together for like a week or something before coming here there's really no expectations so uh they can just do whatever and kind of confuse people as well because a part of what makes a team good uh is to be unpredictable and that's something that VP has lacked uh quite a bit like you know what's coming but the more the the question is are you going to be able to stop it are you going to have all the protocols and utility you know in place to do it uh and sometimes you still lose because they also have [ __ ] s sick aimers individually right um but yeah it's it's going to be a process so far so far okay I guess this is a making playoffs even against not so good teams is it's like something that the old the old the Cloud9 with electronic and Perfecto needed realistically some like decent results that would give them more confidence and time to to figure [ __ ] out um but yeah let's um I I want to finish I think uh I think they should take it slow and enjoy the process and then they benefit from the ending because if they're going to rush with that it's going to be a huge problem and I agree with you that shouldn't take eepl and and bed boom data also like we should they should expect them to self to win from the scratch and if they will understand it and find their identity we're going to see really good team like I'm curious you know how they will do deal with this though because like now they have a week so that's another week like on top of what they have already you know so maybe there's going to be some changes like also like I could see them you know jumping on the train during the playoffs because like they will change a lot of stuff because whatever they were doing during the groups is not working and so like they will come into the playoffs a slightly different team again you know maybe some more stuff that they will build up on you know so maybe they'll do they will make another like a decent run you know and then like this could snowball into more like good results but it would take like a good start like otherwise they would just be like okay this is not working this is not working we have to change this again we have to keep changing you know and instead of like finally finding something that works and at least running with that until the end of the season like that's that's kind of yeah where they are at the moment um let's touch on G2 so their run they beat tyou and then they lost to Mongols then they lost to M8 and I was like Jesus Christ what's happening J [ __ ] man and then they beat Falcons and uh 2-1 Lost first map won the second two pretty convincingly and then they play against M80 to go through in the first map ancient G2 against M80 co- casted by device one of the most entertaining games of Counterstrike I've watched for a long time at the same time it 50% like can we eliminate both teams and 50% this is this is the best like realistically there are some great like rotations some good utility from like sin for example like he was getting in position at the right times then we had like Nico was struggling like he was really having an unlucky half I think device really pointed that out really well like how many times he's like there's a microsc he catches a glimpse he's like he's ready for the guy but the guy is also like for no reason waiting for him to Peak I mean there's a reason obviously he kind of expected but still then he gets nated then he gets like spamed through a smoke and like six like rifle rounds he does even have an aim duel right it's like this this is going awful and then you see in the overtime that one round two rounds but the first one the ace Peak ni just like insane Counter Strike beautiful the reactions from everyone Taz doing some stupid [ __ ] it was it was great I love that it was I I watch that because I didn't actually catch it and I was just like Jesus they play triple over time again like this must have been horrible so I'm glad I'm glad you gave it a good review because I didn't watch that one it's it was it was so fun the second map was yeah wasn't wasn't that exciting but yeah some props some props to M80 for sure they they're playing pretty pretty solid Counter-Strike finally they have a full team again after having uh def stand in for the major and Kat right um so kind of promising promising from them um but the question of G2 is it's still like I feel like Hunter is not doing what he needs to do on this lineup and I I will actually bring up a tweet um from P from yeah I wanted I wanted to say about that yeah it's a good good take so I'll just read the kind of the short part it says finish analyzing g2's recent performances one thing is clear they made a huge tactical error since bringing in Nexa uh don't misunderstand me Nexa isn't a poor player but he doesn't fit g2's play style the tldr is that essentially he not as active as G2 would need or what jks was and that then shifts Nico and Hunter into more like playmaking positions um and essentially just kind of breaks down the structure of of G2 um which I think everyone can agree that Hunter was amazing in the mid rounds like he was the guy getting these like boring un not uninspiring but very forgettable one and two kills in the mid rounds and like a 4v4 or 3v3 that just helped so much and Nico was obviously clutching and then you don't see as much of that especially Hunter as uh as much as you you've seen before and considering they even brought in Nexa kind of explaining like oh he's gonna bring up other players he definitely did not um he individually has been playing okay but it's not really enabling Nico or Hunter to do any better so what did you think coo about the about the take I think I think that P had a really good take on this one because and someone I read today about two aces of Nico someone said on Twitter as well that like it felt like um renissance niik when he just clearing the Angles and doing what he's supposed to do like he was good in go with specific angles and now he need to look for five angles and I think it's a big problem if your star player who is good taking those so many positions and maybe like because of NEX not playing Super aggressive on other positions they need to do more job yeah we all expect much better numbers from Hunter because we we are used to it in CS goo he was significant player for this team and doing a lot of job I think like controversial talking about bringing up Nexa and if a good AGL and stuff but I feel like this team can be a better of obviously a better team like something just doesn't go right in this team and I think they probably should make a change but it's it's easier to judge from the outside because like it's easy to say like the two must play better Nikos should play better and stuff and this we should blame some of the players in this team but I think uh we don't know what's going behind the team but obviously it's not what we expected from such kind of players and I think like nman need to step up this season to become better but in my opinion they need changes like and not I'm not talking about IG people have I mean people said oh this is Hunter he is the best rated player in G2 for this event which is true um doesn't really for me change that like i' I've seen him in these positions now where he just doesn't feel as comfortable and as secure as he used to be because he's he used to be a player that doesn't give away his life for for nothing uh like ever uh but sometimes now I feel like he probably just a lack of confidence um in some situations even when he is in these situations where he used to thrive it's not the same uh level of performance but what do you what do you think Striker um I just got distracted on the side um so I was like paying attention to like half of what you said can you repeat the question I mean essentially Hunter Hunter Nexa to Nico relationship in in G2 and how is that working uh I feel like I've been saying the same kind of thing for for a long time so I don't know it's like I don't want to repeat the same thoughts that I've had about G2 forever because I didn't actually watch a lot of their games like I watched one of the like cluster [ __ ] it was the first m81 that they that they lost and I was just confused about everything I was like this is not a top like this doesn't look like a top team you know like the way what you were talking about with uh with broi um like how he can have such a high ceiling but also such a low floor I felt the same way about the entire G2 and every like how everybody played in that it wasn't just about like it's you see it on Nico you know like ho was talking about those two Aces he Nico can look exactly like he used to it's just he doesn't do it as often and he just has a much lower floor than he used to before as well like where like the games where it didn't doesn't go well for him he just doesn't look like the same that he was before he just doesn't have the same moments a lot of the time but then you know he goes into another map and then he has his best CS2 map you know that we saw against Falcons you know so it's like this entire team at the moment feels very consistent apart well apart from wanty he also had a [ __ ] game and the mols one I think was the one that they or like in the first M8 one I think he was also pretty off but apart from him there's not a lot of consistency from game to game and that's I don't know if that's because of C 2 and like because of the way that Nico feels about CS2 probably that kind of like um that sort of sentiment is probably kind of across the whole team um whether as a as a result of Nico or not like it could just be the same sentiment from the rest of the team as well but that's just how I feel about um about G2 at the moment just like they can look like a top team they could beat FaZe on a good day but then like we see what they can do also when it goes the exact opposite way yeah I mean obviously Mony is the is the Talk of the Town and uh everyone is hyping him up and it's easy to have fun or be sad about just like the prospect of G2 without modesty right now like what would this team be if they had just like an average average oper and not like the best oper in N CS but I've actually been slightly like bugged by the way he is described by the by the community and some pundits and stuff uh as like simply the best player in Counter Strike which I think is he him and Don are obviously like above everyone else and that's without uh that's super clear but I don't really can't really get behind the that you know monasi is the best player in Counter Strike and not mentioning Don in the same sentence I I I can't get behind I think that's a bit uh unfair to a guy that obviously Mony had more matches he played more uh but that is not really a thing that you can fault Don for like it's not Don's fault that his team didn't have a good R ranking before he joined the team like that doesn't really make any sense it's not his fault they they didn't join uh EPL they had invite you know yeah they had an invite like five days before yeah but they couldn't they couldn't make it worth with visas so I don't know if it's a VISA problem or not but if they didn't I got it got it confirmed like it was because of visas they they just couldn't couldn't go so just let's just uh remember Don comes to Kit his first like big L and he drops a 1.70 rating MVP uh beats FaZe in the Grand Final like wh why are we acting as if this is not like insane he next tournament he does the armr really well he goes to the major goes to quarterfinals barely loses to phasee again like the one of the most most uh L uh and Arena [ __ ] uh teams that exists like is that bad is that bad from Don no it's not like it's again a great performance from Don and that's like all he got to play because the situation is what it is right okay if we're just looking at who performed more over how many Maps yeah you can Edge it towards monasi and say like oh he deserves it but also Mony doesn't have an MVP right d I think if if you give Don more time there's no reason why not to expect him to match what monesy is doing and again if people say in my opinion monest is the best I don't have any uh problem with that I just have a problem with being like yeah Monas is the best player in the world and not saying anything more I just feel it's disingenuous yeah I think the reason for that is like I was thinking about that as well like when you were first bringing that up like when you were talking about the Runa show and I was looking at it that I actually have had a similar feeling to myself about Don and I realized why because like he's a victim of his own success and that's because he set such a [ __ ] high bar in Kavita that was like impossible to keep up and then he goes to the armr he had those couple of vertigo games you know that didn't go his way people suddenly started thinking okay he's a fraud like he's not he's not going to do anything anything close to like what he did in Kavita but then ever since then at the major he was still great like he wasn't the same as in Kavita like again that was just an impossible bar to keep up but he was like on Mon's level during the major you know at least if not better you know at the at the same time you know so it's not like I agree with you 100% like it's I feel like people maybe are um putting too much emphasis on the fact that he didn't match up to kavit after that even though he was still probably the best player in the world or at least on par with Monas after that you know not including Kavita so I feel like that's that's where people maybe feel like he's dropped off but not as much as people think let's say I mean yeah what where are the stats so his um major stats 1.35 rating at a major which is second only to monasi was 1.37 obviously Don had eight Maps mon he had 14 yeah that's nice but you know that's top two that still puts him in the conversation for the best player I I you can't you can't be not in this conversation that's it's just uh crazy to me what do you think which I don't understand why we're sleeping on Z well right not he's not one of the best players in the world no I mean for if you talk about three I will say Z as well I think he is for this year a level below these two yeah because it's the same because with the expectations as you said like because when they don't come to came to kavit and set the bar so high so everyone expect D would to be the same good like he was last year and at the remark he was delivering and major obviously not so good I agree but I think like why people are so so cool with the mon be number one because not play like if we take the players right now Spirit has a better players than uh so when J wins some matches everyone like how is he's doing this with this team because people are underestimate obviously some of the players of the team is just and if we talk about spirit it's much a stronger team but I agree with you that I think like M and Don and I'm just Fanboy of Z monis and Don is the best players and they should be in the same uh same sentence but as you already mentioned Spirit doesn't play so much tournaments that's why and today IIA brought the topic that uh don is struggling because of that like some Russ social media he said that he doesn't feel good playing so not so many tour tournaments and he want to show his best because he's in Prime now and we want to see real rival so I hope he going to play more tournaments yeah I we'll see him in data um that's the next one what else do they have actually they have um are you coming Dall right uh no not me I was I wanted to but there was a I have Dallas and spring final as well and three tournaments in three weeks or four weeks or whatever wasn't wasn't the easiest same I'm also going to see Taylor Swift so sorry can't can't make it priorities um let's just talk about the upcoming groups uh quickly I know some people mentioned Mongols but we can also talk about them after the playoffs since they are going to be a playoffs and we can have just a better better overview of the love Mong obviously great result to beat some really really good teams go to the playoffs of EPL if I'm not mistaken their first like I don't even know what EPL is is this a big it is a big event so first playoffs of a of a big event so that's uh that's a great thing for them and like a great achievement again for like Asian counter- strike which has not had really a lot of reason to to celebrate but the upcoming groups are CN D which will be played out over the over the next week starting tomorrow um I think overall the groups look not as competitive I think especially Group C um I'll just go through it quickly so these are the opening matches so ma against bad news kangaroos then we have ANS against gamer Legion and struggled gamer Legion just made some changes as well Furia against liquid Furia playing with a with a stand in and then fors with smooya uh so he wasn't able to come on the show today so he had to get Hooch and uh and Monty uh who also have like some some new players right and this is also just a problem of EPL of their invites and and see coming so early that it just ended up with some teams and and like groups that don't really don't really seem like they make a lot of sense and then group T is complexity Pera nip heroic big against Big Boss Metal Gear Solid shout out and fly Quest against na'vi um yeah I wanted to talk about liquid and and ask you which what do you what do you think is uh what do you think is happening prob basically uh it's a hard topic I mean like uh I think that the thing that when he went for I jail kind of ruined his confidence also I think like people get used to his style being super aggressive and now it's not so easy to be like like it's used to be go and I think um this team if if it's going to work like the same we talked about VP much more harder cocktail because because you have Zeus who Obviously good coach with a major winning experience you have kadan with his view game you have one Brazilian player you have one Canadian player and you have MX who played in VP with one style and then he came to liquid he was supposed to be a number one star now before and now he need to adapt and become a different player and I think like their expectation were so high coming to play in an easy region and when they met m 80 who doing so good uh without like Superstar players but I think it's very hard for them at the moment I mean like they have everything to be on top and even have a really big Advantage when you can qualify to World Championships from America I don't know to be honest um with f last time maybe like three or four months and he was looking confident and stuff but watching the games he just doesn't feel good and um I feel like either maybe one months or two months he will become better as he used to be or he need to change the team because I don't feel like he's doing what he's supposed to do and it's not fault of his or or the coach or the player or the igl I don't know but you can get the good players on the paper but you need work on the chi MYRY and I saw the some movies and he said like they have really good um wise like they are talking good to each other they have managers they have psychologist and stuff but it feels like just something doesn't work so for me it's hard to judge but I hope he'll bounce back my boy I mean it's been we we've heard the same things kind of already from the not necessarily all the way to the start I think at the start everybody was like oh this is zymon and blah blah blah because they had kind of like a good month before they actually had to play anything um with like all this like boot camp without PCS stuff kind of um all this um performance side of it and like these uh what we saw in some of the videos and then they very quickly once they start got to playing realize that exactly because they have so many people who have such a big voice that's becoming a problem right so whatever too many cooks in the kitchen um and that's like they're slowly I feel like undoing undoing that and just like having KD and be the the real leader and then having everybody else take a little bit of a step back um I don't know I don't know how possible that is after like you've set up the whole team as like okay this is our main like vocal Trio and and these are going to be the guys who are shaping the team um I suppose it's just going to take some some time until everybody gets used to that new reality you know that okay we're just gonna have this guy have more much more of a say than he did up until now so that we don't have these clashes all the time about how we want to play so um yeah that's that's probably the biggest worry in liquid and it's really it's really hard to solve it because you know uh um even though like people can say we have different views but we all want to win at some point like you come someone take the number one voice someone second third but during the time if you don't succeed at some point you think like maybe I should take more part like in talking maybe I should call more and say some things that were significant in my team and important so it can be a really huge problem because when it's when just beginning everyone is so nice like let's do this let's do like this we had this good case and this team and we had this this let's try it it works at the beginning like everyone is uh calling everyone is listening but when the time passes by it's really hard to stay like the same like you you you may think like what he's talking about like I know how to do this and even though you can't say it it it stucks in your mind and the day by day it gets much harder for you so when you have three different people from different different countries different regions different communities really hard to hide your ego so if they find this way like where they have this like they make this good cocktail or sell I don't know it will work out but so far it looks not so good do you what do you have as expectations from them at pro league though considering their group like playing against Furia first and then this group is [ __ ] that's that was my exact response it is it's like literally what I said like three months ago man when they decided these these uh these groups it's like okay at this point it's not as bad but guess what you don't decide groups three months in advance for a reason yeah I don't know they they can beat fua I think they should be very nice they should beat Furia come on like they should they have for and yeah I mean they should be they should qualify if they don't qualify I don't know this band I don't know you can't disband with such salary bro you not rules everything around me I mean obviously not the spand but it would be a huge huge disappointment if they if they don't make playoffs here um obviously they didn't qualify they after Chang Du they flew back to to the US or somewhere I don't know yeah forc qualifiers right for ewc qualifiers and they lost to M8 in the in the final match which sounds horrible and realistically it is horrible that they had to fly from China to America to play this and then to Europe again um but also in such a tough it's a it's a tight schedule and also it seems like M80 are not that bad um so it makes it in hindsight less bad uh but still still rough for a team of liquids uh liquid level to not get that qualifier to lose like a domestic qualifier essentially that's that's rough um yeah but it's part of the game it's there is no excuses maybe so also twist is maybe pretty happy that he doesn't have to play in Saudi Arabia who knows he didn't want to join FAL because of that so after maybe you know I was thinking about that line and I was like okay maybe he didn't try his absolute hardest but that he was the best player in the team I think in that qualifier so as he has been as he has been since this team came together but yeah it is it's a it's a tricky one It's Tricky one obviously he's he you know people still uh bring up the leaving phase thing to him even though it's yeah it was a different time and everything but he even he must sometimes look at you know where faces just chilling playing lens playoffs to all the finals yeah and him having to travel around the world all the time and and playing online qualifiers and to you know online like American competition pretty pretty rough but um hashtag believe twist he's been he's been great though individually at least that that has not uh has not faltered um before we close the show I don't want to go into like predicting anything more here but is there any other team from um Group C and D that you think is worth paying attention to specifically I was just thinking about na'vi in general maybe heroic I think there's a lot of pressure on heroic to start performing again a little bit just because they started on a really big high U because everybody just like thought okay it's maybe it's going to take some time that's a completely new team coming like from three different directions and then they almost make playoffs in Kavita they they make it to the they made it to the major right yeah they did make it to the major they they performed really well up to that point and then since then they've been struggling so it feels like that's this is also the time for them to to go back up otherwise maybe there's going to be some question marks and probably a lot of pressure on Nikos because he's kind of been like that's the obvious place to upgrade next if you want to make this roster better it has to be in the oper position because he's like barely breaking 1. z z ratings since in the past couple of months so that's that's uh that's something that I will keep eye on for sure for that group coach uh Group C obviously Mouse Sports is a clear favorite ands I don't know like I can't say anything about other teams Group D interesting to watch new and AP uh they remove T to take this polish guy kasperski yeah I me they already have one more standing so it's kind of like it's I me is is just sick they didn't replace him he's just sick yeah no but I'm watching I'm waiting for a match big boss is going to be interesting Big Boss Big Boss I'm just about na'vi like we had this like if you guys remember like for a long time there was this thing like where the team Major doesn't doesn't doesn't do nearly as well at the next tournament obviously we've been a little bit more removed from that like usually it's because like it's like right the next event you know it's like immediately after but they didn't play in changdu um they only play um play here that's the their first time that they play out uh after the major so I wonder if the same will apply to them if they're also going to take a take a step down but I don't I don't see a reason for them to Wi this group at least maybe in the playoffs who knows but that's still like it also feels like a completely different tournament once you go into the playoffs because it takes three weeks to play and like the especially the first two groups like they have a week week off or even more than that so I don't know yeah it feels like you know we're so far removed from the major that this is not even a storyline it's like okay how does the team that won the major do yeah this is like a month ago now like we've had a bunch of things be played you know in the meantime MH I mean that's it that's it from the show I feel like uh we had some nice discussions about teams we didn't have like U too many crazy like recent news so we had a bit more time to to discuss um some of these teams in in more depth so if you guys like that let us know in the in the comments um if you want chat back uh
