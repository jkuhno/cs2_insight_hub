cuz it's very hard to know who's going to take this win who have you got who's your favorite right now I mean just looking at support around te I think I've got to go with the Mongol as heroic versus Mongol the Grand Final here best of five first map dust two oh yeah it sounds like they're liking the Mongols and I think we've got some more fans here let's not get ahead of ourselves cuz heroic are coming in with blooded lust they want this win just as much picks a player out of the sky nurs falls and hero explode out long with utility the two top performers of this Tournament down in the pistol round well the Damage Done to 910 Tess down by Blitz as that pistol goes swinging from the site puring down Longs side doing as much damage as physically possible but heroic now thinned out to just three players staying committed to their goal of getting into the a bomb site Mongols have still got 910 in the sight hiding behind the boxes but it's they confidently Peaks out from Goose blinded caught and dropped by SH now techno with short nearly a lineup but it's Blitz again Landing shots here for the Mongols It's Just sh Now 1 V3 and they're low a couple of very low plays and if you get that kill on techno then you start to believe there's a chance he goes straight for the repeat no fear no fear from techno despite his shot from death for this is this is heroic want to you want to catch him off guard right Tri with the rifle on the AK yeah absolutely makes sense but it's a risky move techno's going for a push speaking of risk here he goes right toward kick and okay yeah Tech 9 is going to doome him techno goes down first mon have to play the rest of the round 45 N1 saving for the orbs so he has armor USP they were not expecting this Force spy they're going to find out the hard way they got to go completely under armed for it but the rifle will carry them through perhaps Blitz with three kills looking for four on the rifle down in CT support comes in and this for SP for Heroic should be thrown to the Wayside with that kill kicks in low in the engagement no bomb control no shot now run back and get a little bit of an upgrade picking up that MP9 but there's no way kakan gets into a wable position here another great round from Blitz we've talked about him as one of the best frag leaders at this level of Counter Strike and I think that's very exciting to have that conversation about an Counter Strike team is he really is we've got AK here on sh so yeah just keeping it interesting yeah they're going to try and just keep this this money modest for Mongol he has spawn so Tessa sets him up he's down to zero bucks now after buying this but I respect the attempt however it won't go far and we have no more armored players so Tess is going to take it but a limited avail and again 910 plays USP try to grab the AK but 910 has the best Twitter game though he know made a Twitter made one tweet I mean M did the same thing he made like one tweet after thing is it it's it's kind of the thing my goat oh USP apparently is enough grabs the M4 low Health though going to have to back up just looking for a bit more damage here heroic but it is going to be that comfortable three and0 lead for the Mongols they're going to be able to pick this one up and starting strong on Dust two is essential for Mongol we've SE how strong heroic were against OG in their opening day but how much of that was OG and how much of it was heroic we definitely push mostly in the direction of heroic being individually strong on the day I mean heroic a lot of these players with a lot of experience right that's why you can't count them out it's not just the form of nerds oh my God all right he's got a chance here 33 seconds 91's low in HP oh but in a great position tucked in on default there's a headshot angle for young crouches and Tess's crossair placement is good this could be a fourth on for the ace misso waits he wait some more for the right time to strike yeah considering the amount bought in these first couple of rounds for her they've got a very nice first rifle and de puts into use it's gone on the cross all smokes created senu look to disrupt him as they push forward Damage Done on towards Nur first oh a lot of damage being done unconfirmed though through that smoke and he's burning he's losing a lot of his health with every second that takes on and that bomb finally going down look how much damage is done to heroic but no players falling her they've got three players barely standing on the server yeah but like you said unconfirmed Mongols don't even know how close they were to breaking into this round instead they're going to have to give it up immediately you said they're out of position right leaning B andu committed to long it really was down to one player if we even got this awp hunting oh B got that low Molly so they're going to try and pick up the pace a little bit stakks are looking for an open he got it previously towards long now starts be his teammates coming in charging it oh techno has got a hold only manages one and so it leaves the deagle of sens under a lot of pressure at the back of the sight and it's not a single kill CU Tess has that follow up as well two entries from tesses and then round feels over at this point cover from long lets 910 get out but this might just be him setting up for a save they could consider a three on three but kitless right now and it's delivered given on a silver platter Mongols can they serve up a around they're now encroaching upon this B bomb site some of the time ticked away we're getting to that halfway point now utility going in that smoke should allow them out of the doorways kicks will have eyes on that but realizes window also a possibility so he goes forward he gets underneath they go through into the sight dter Fring out suddenly all the Damage Done by one man and that that forces 910 into the save call and heroic into their second round win yeah very nice swap off the awp there for Dexter needed something a little more malleable able to turn between a lot of positions and trade out his teammate but eventually Mongols playing passive enough will have to be dealt and execute so hero line up with a set up in mid to B the rest up cat great damage it's not going to change the end goal herok going a anyway smoke execute being put in place utility now Landing towards n flash connect perfectly goes into the peak blind and Blitz does not do enough to turn this in favor of Mongols you've got MHO long still worried about a push out of there and Tess is in C already removing any of the save ideas that Mongol have so another player take it away now MHO starts to back in from long but good Peak from kickand MHO can do nothing about that and techno has no other option but to save this M4 yeah just some really strong individuals right now on heroic right ner in that form we saw yesterday and Tess is very cheeky lurk into the smoke able to deny saves maybe all of them in fact techno in trouble three bullets and they found him Rog not letting you leave with anything in these rounds hunting all of the saves that they can double op set up oh yeah Mongols love this it's not the most meta but if there were any map for it it would be D two and senzu puts it to use well that gets a bit of excitement going and sendu moving dter forcing Kian to pick up the awp instead once they've got him there they know they can start to take the next steps in their plan yeah this still relies on his team getting a little space right you want to try and force a reaction so they walk into nerds but Mongols are doing their typical very passive line he's just going to be able to cut down rotations so BR need entries on a in the meantime it's MHO in the pit n's actually playing a little bit more active checking on timings Mao on an off angle able to get one he couldn't fall off they committ to the trade nice spacing for Heroic 910 blind great Flash from the captain and ner is here to sink the knife in the back of the Mongols but senzu is too quick yeah too aware of that nerds goes down and suddenly they're back in this fight the Mongols with 30 seconds left have dropped the bomb and put it on kicks down alone into this I mean it makes perfect sense why n would hold on that long but if he plays earlier he gets at least one kill as they're Crossing in Dexter going straight back for the same angle 9 this time oh kicks that goes down 910 annihilates him that's despicable that is brutal through the top of the box and L smoke and the Ops are working for the goals now Sen's turn oo can just see over the top they have an ex they just going to dry walk in you get what you pay for senzu hits another and that will cool it off for Heroic don't want to walk into this angle anymore going to send n through the double doors Mongol is not offering up a chance not offering him up anything at this point senzu has got a scope down mid moves out of the window and it's another one from the office s through by the reek punish by De he's in the open Tech you're in the open buddy oh god he has no idea he didn't look towards the door shush was already up and techno was so worried about the tunnels that he got taken out by the doors and suddenly the B bomb side Falls in favor of heroic now Mongols still have the numbers advantage and both players are low but dster can make the difference here he realizes he has to be aggressive he has to thin the herd early his teammate can peek off of him both of them low they line up he grabs a freebie flicking back won't connect and Blitz shuts down the round I admire the aggression there I think they play too passive they try and tuck in behind boxes they can get NED they can get cleaned out by moles like I said her have been very good with the util so do they have a flash for cat here typically want to use something to get an or off this angle that's exactly what they'll do but the rifles were anti they swing out after the fact a bit of a lineup gets a little awkward but Blitz saves it yet again the captain puts him in his backpack and puts a lot of damage down range but it's still not done jumping in with a flashbang flick won't connect 910 has to give it up here and wait for his team yeah throwing flashes to retreat to safety his teammates are arriving quite quickly though sends you on an op techn on the M4 and d goes into shortess is stuck as he creeps closer and closer realizes eventually going to get that plant in and so he's going for it right now just plants in the open he gets the bomb down but now he's stuck now he's alone in an island and his damage is piling up he's so low on health but somehow still alive until finally Sor Peaks on up and puts it all on dster sure a winable but still difficult as dxer sits in short he's getting peppered a little bit overextended into the open he couldn't quite see his Target and techno will take him out in the end good reservation for the Mongols right in that three onone they lose senzu to a trade Tess is jumping over beams of bullets coming towards him straight out go straight in into that fight techno goes down but senzu again plugging the Gap with a double on the awp but damage oh it's awkward for 910 oh he did he was on the side arm and really awkward scenario fortunately for the Mongols MHO was able to trade the kill out but they know they've got alone and they're fighting on two front from short and long and eventually Mao can't handle that pressure and they know exactly where senzu was Last detected and that's over towards that b bomb site cheeky little fake smoke as he picks up another one he's going to rout but is he even giving this a go very hesitant I mean he's low he's got to come back in from short two players to collect it is so tough to think about a round win here for senzu let's see what he's made of they know where he is now it's short two bullets smoke the sight with a player in pit and one closer at long senzu is running out of time running out of chances does not have the in on the whereabouts s just goes for the last chance no scope and will fall at the Wayside Fades gets spotted doesn't matter than a commit and sensu thanks him for that 5 on four and options open up they can drop a mid to B they should be able to read that it's a two two setup either way so what the Mongols like it's this split senzu and the nerd's position in mid kick peing not the only player spotted but certainly the only player Fring it's a great head shot kicks out to go down test say oh it's only one from the side and that's not enough it's a dominant pistol R win here for for the Mongols to kick off this second half but it's such a tight game it's a risky move and they're going to do it anyway hero love these buys three MP9 and a scout what a setup look easy but Blitz oh yeah that Ma 10 making money and making moves double and lower tunnels from the cerebral assassin and now D and KES left in a 2v4 Mongols in control until this point his kicks kill back does leave some questions because 910 is still in the lower tunnels with a bomb they haven't quite got to the sight just yet they're getting closer to this bomb you got oh you start to get worried but Blitz has it covered for now dxer should not beting away for this on the USP and careful indeed Hugo H it doesn't get out of hand but certainly there were chances now Blitz he's just got eyes on Lower tunnel tra oh he knows they did this to him a few times didn't they in that first half so he want some Revenge he wants to take n out of there but that is some fantastic way to get out of danger now D has to worry about the lower tunnels and it's just clocked at his mind hold on can't get preoccupied have to worry about this lower tunnels potential they assembled a boost it doesn't work but they just rip his head off [Applause] instead not a bad move knowing there's no or players as well with de's Dead flash goes in and through the smoke as well her find out the hard way they hear these foot steps in the sight the mid to B smoke only goes him in for security shush through with one more but that's not going to change the outcome of this round bomb planted and already hunting ensuing for the Mongols Firepower seeming unmatched at this point in time senzu is just so sharp the way he just rips taker off short with a head shot on the AK against the awp I thought the was at least getting one there you go if it was anyone but the Mongols I'd agree and this is really telling to the fact that we we mentioned earlier Blitz is one of those frag 19 he's having one of those games these guys are Kings of the white swing on the Hun is on it's just T holding on to his me and actually works out pretty well for him a double grab an AK instead with the hunter still coming and Tess still holds on yeah all point any further that's fine that's solid work for tesses but Mongols are still going to be happy they have a bank yeah they have a lot of money dter no longer allowed to stay in short with that Molotov so he forc he's forced back rather to take a different angle double ups that it worked for the Mongols let's see if n can try in he certainly can over the top of that smoke he takes down 910 he takes the oper of the other team away in the blink of an eye now he waits for a lower tunnels push from senzu not coming his way just yet instead perhaps this blitz boy could be his second offering and nerds with a second Kill from the sniper puts heroic two players up walking back as well what a quick Counter Strike from nerds they may earn the angle now but oror the advantage 5v3 and if they want to go for this B split it's going to be n you have to worry about again the flank coming in tform right now as well he's got them in his sights he's got the round here in his hands if he can just execute perfectly he's taking one head shot decid he doesn't want to throw his life away he'll stay alive and now ner he's under a bit of pressure he's done very well in this round so far but is there anything else for n oh the sniper that is a great shot he's under pressure moving through the fire and senu turns back to drop T but there's four more players to find 25 it's more likely that he gets dropped in the next seconds Andes the play to collect him got to say the Highlight there has to be nur's man that was huge impact with a player who so good on the rifle you wonder why he would ever even think about using the awp but that's some fantastic that's why or maybe he's cooking n's back to Middle next to that the cat oh is he about to do it again it was close very close oh Stakes of this time to chim in th for Heroic sniper again getting the job done so annoying to get past aren't they these orbs on Dust two tail As Old As Time 20 years of people regretting to throw the flash here comes the execute smokes in kicks out and D the double set up here on the ra to deal with the short plate from the Mongol they are charging right in MHO at the front they're turning away their backs turn and senzu getting the trade effectively and still is heroic up at a better position they've got an extra player long as well is biting his time but a Miss shot it went right through the wickets and he's going back at it again this time second time baset he will not miss a tough shot he hadn't landed on his feet just yet and so nerds instead goes up with his sniper and it's a naughty play it will not work out for nerds it's shush instead as to CL bomb is not planted and head shots L senu sings and it's a 4K from The Young player oh my goodness four kills in that pandemonium when Dex is getting rep Peaks off he's jumping up on boxes again alone in this position they are try to fight senzu going into the body shots it's he's just going to melt away combined with that utility damage so the hero for the Mongols down ner spotted on the jump has moved out long test as here he knows to Behind Blue don't need to swing here let them come to you very unlikely clear this late especially if kicks and just chose any leg oh the flash that doesn't even help it almost about to walk into him instead as a captain to swing wide and just say good night tessis finally activates I bet Tess was just waiting for his moment and thund Away you take it you survive another round and you pick up a second orb heroic Not Dead Yet five players stay alive away on the smoke yeah senu is going to be frustrated about losing his life in that fashion and nerz is able to get away with it now dxer could get a second here he actually to find the second kill of the round for Heroic Mong once again a tough spot and D wanted to tank that mly he he was thinking was definitely going to be a peak eventually do a cat execute don't necessarily need to go into the a bomb site with MHO moving out through mid but going to drop back off C if he gets his kill on NDS then there is a pathway to be but he has to get the kill it's so essential shot there we go but there's a gap there's no CT smoke and that's a problem because King's got eyes on this they had to just fight him they have to just F him Blitz buries two it's now going to be a 2v2 as sh is inside of the sight under the window here they doesn't stop incredible play from the ing game leader and this map is about to come to a close battered and bruised are heroic and dster has to pull them out of a hole and through the window he's about to get pinned to the wall a 4K for Blitz teed up and he's about to drive it home it's 910 to secure it mle pick up us twoo this best of five grand final is looking good for the Mongols they've got their opponent's M pick well here they go now we'll see if that campaign gets kicked off in the right direction here you go creeping forward into a double set up on this site 91's faking out in Middle right now but it's all up to This n setup Julie in a that could be lethal that could absolutely tear apart this setup as they run through into the jaws of heroic double for Dexter he will be dropped they're splitting the donut though low HP should be an easy finish off shush de the dead Tess and NS have got to do it but a dink iMed as that bomb crosses out he'll finish the job nurs now we know he's good but surely this is a bridge too far oh these head shots from Mongols are lethal right now finished the fight before they even start they didn't win a pistol Hugo they didn't win the pistol so there's always next one there's always the next pistol maybe once more trying to abuse the anchor of shush who had trouble in that previous map getting pressured early but D again joining him on on this boost dropped immediately through the smoke a lot of damage they won't overc commit that probably still would have been a kill if they did Hook Line and Sinker can they stay afloat two smokes in double cave cave is just such a dangerous place to go on a anti Eco anti Force by Kicks up on a kbby though with that flash from shush it's perfect you might see that flash assist and realize that's the a anchor here we're in trouble big h b for blit they need this clean entry though as the rifles reap rewards it's 2v3 make it two shush comes through the smoke and Mongol don't have time to rotate surely 15 seconds around the back and 9 10's gone down so now it has to be elimination and it looks like it's going to be easy for nurse to turn around and collect that so they have come back with a force by here heroic and yeah Mongol a little red in the face about that one have the round winning play force your own for Mongols though you're not going to be as good as heroic Force by you're going to have Tech 9 in here and we know they're potent with these we see yesterday they capable of winning Tech 9 rounds and they get Speedy they go towards B but canel by that moloto they just like okay we're just going to go through it fire at the feet shot coming in Tess peeking out from the cubby cleaning up on a double he's got dter initially there to help him and they have stall out they've taken the sting out of those Mong attack yeah and because they hit so early they have so many more nades on hero Molly forces 91 into the open he hits a range shot but he still leaves Blitz in a 1 V2 and they're coming in for the kill that's dangerous smoke in the way Blitz has a bit of cover swings out to finish the job and nuts doesn't need to lose this akv Tech 9 this is his short Blitz say not on this world I was going to say you know heroic screw they don't need the pistol if they win the force but somehow goes back against them they got to keep these battles going and they start strong at least nerds is actually using the smoke look at this he's going to peek on up eventually trying to break of smoke Whispers And he gets back to safety H I was a little scared there for a moment but n is okay my God if he reloads they could come through as well they want to bite hangs around go silent for the moment but Nur is starting to get a little bit more aggressive advances his position closer to red again he got teammates smoke Fades away and it's an easy kill on the end for ner as 910 Peaks right into his Crosshair Advantage nice sing with heroic and some way they are in the better position kick needs to be careful not a clean fight got the re gets the on the last bullet yeah that was actually kicks and trying to go in for the gun but it flew back it dropped to the bottom of middle so he couldn't find it took his life for that and they know about the flank nerds back in the same position with the swing back in this time he gets his revenge it might be enough to win the round here three on two low Health low time how can you win this if you're the Mongols that's that's one way to start D still inside of cave he can push out a Jag now and start trying to get there flank going in middle but looks like he got a chance on S he's brought him down and now MHO so low he's so low on health faked it faked the step got to commit this is going to be tough I don't know how he doesn't get that yeah so low he would have taken sh down with a body shot but doesn't land it that's an off angle right there that's not one you're clearing and it's a 3B setup as well so the longer this hangs around the more potent this play is just realizes the map is quiet he's got a block it's a really annoying but yeah they just have to at this point got to go through got to go through into the attack smokes donut shush does well with one but can't get away with a second and yeah that's the bomb plant secure 3v3 post plant as well look at this pushing into the temple nearly getting his chance D and just about getting around the corner think can buy a few more seconds that Molly is big they take the control back but kicks and comes through spawn instead an on tourage three CTS moving in as blit face an off angle to try and catch that bomb tap leaving techno in a 1 V2 they're already on it they're sticking the defuse techno no chance he's getting them off with a fake through the smoke and heroic finally do it backto back rounds breaking Mongols let see if it works out for them there is risk involved in this so they throw almost zero util at the start of the round they don't want to reveal what they've got get an entry in B with the one AK in the round put to use looking for a second around mid as well that's ugly though Blitz really needs that kill as dexa comes in cover nerds they find a two for one it's landed back on its feet for Heroic the Gap is B but techno's not taking it techno goes back to try and fight at range nice shot from 910 needed to land that one he's got an AK to play with now instead but it should have been a 5v3 for Mongols early Tech opener Blitz his chance and mid really got to take those the 3v2 is not unwinable right now for Mongol it does feel tough though yeah it felt like if they just hit be off techno's entry this could have been a done deal but now it's reinforced there's a flank closing the back door still gets another entry so much damage done on two of these players 910 finished off low Health on the Young Gun this should be a bridge too far nerds is low as well senu had the bomb he could go back to a but he doesn't and he's going to get caught by NS in the end off of the ledge anyway so that's the end that's the end of The Bu forced by heroic have won that inside of Jag dexer is already at the ledge peering down into the beling with the sniper rifle test as close not the range you would have hope for but still just melting senzu yeah beautiful spray trying to put pressure on this aside right now there's two rifles here there's even the awp Techno get a trade and so they won't commit little do they know almost the whole team is here let this or work but it's not being given anything right now now it's moving through the temple was that communicated did they hear the scope doesn't seem like it know going for the kill he'll pay the price you it with another entry dster backed out to watch middle shush pushes into his de demise and we wondered when MHO would pop off apparently now is the [Applause] round that's should win it the little monster even Faking It Blitz gets his revenge Taps that bomb sprays kick and right back through the smoke and Dexter has got to save they never even saw this orb oh eight damage great impact from the he's going into the major you expect the Mongols to to start doing some more damage obviously their goals where they get an extra spot for Asia yeah to break through the you know nerve train that they've been on these high pressure events and games break through at this point right before that cycle is perfect timing but nothing comes easily heric this time through elbow they get stopped but Tess only has an and senzu has a chance toing him down but T so good with that little SMG whoever swings wins man I feel like if senzu gets the swing off there he probably takes that entry and it's a very different round interesting mly Landing in the cubby there but yeah ND can't even go near that because it was low HP still a crossfire oh jumping trying to get the info dexa picks him out of the sky get through this midm smoke looking for an a split got melted last round this time they get through with no resistance now that red smoke is blown open chance to oh no they were way closer than n was ready for it D blinded forced off the arrived on time an absolute fumble here from heroic the pace change was the last thing that already for the communication not flowing like it should there and yeah they maybe the oh they're out mid but no info though yeah you're getting fourman Rush donut with Tech 9 who like to drop their rifles but Kon will always play with a weapons He he'll take nerds his MP7 after he Farms the EOS and take it into the gun round you know he's always giving it up for the team and when you have players like nerds and Tess performing as they are that's exactly what a good Captain should be doing here comes Tess oh aggressive and it works out real well for Tess because he gets in and out yeah yoink he steal away and peel back to safety I mean in a round where you have some weaknesses weaponary speaking that that is a great way they get an advantage obviously with the damage he goes down to the MP9 so Kian gets the upgrade oh and 910 holding for aggression down the B oh he really should have landed one of those won't give him another chance smoke that door off getting us out of there if you want he had one opportunity denied T oh didn't see the head senu plucks it out Shadow Advantage gives Dexter another kill though so this glass or put to use already if they want to a split they' got to get past DEA again Here Comes MHO senu oh getting past dxer is going to prove impossible he's still inside a donut now and they're finally getting that bomb over towards a but it's MHO that must make the play and dexer has his cross smoke coming in though smoke wait for it and now the scope will be severed off from its Vision into the site 35 seconds n are still holding in case this is a fake Mongols do like to get tricky sometimes if they believe in this Co they can get the stick in right now fake comes through first hoping for a break not a fact no scope next dexel so close pistol might just finish the job but it's a little wider off default meanwhile fast flank yeah this is real fast M's dead of the utility so it's all a n 10 and through the back of the big box he needs a land and so close yet so far as shush will take him out is just indomitable inside of donut of the Mongols pick the decision to buy paid off in a big Way Glass Cannon get 4,800 you're basically being told to buy the or glass it's too good to be true it ain't I like this from senzu taking himself into the fire doom again he's got himself a head shot on kicks in at the top of the ramp I just wish they commit with these cuz look they turn around so quick and test his knows he's just walk down in response they just use it to get an entry they never walk up that ramp back to a it's their game plan but has it Beed fruit for the Mongols arguably no sto out by that utility as well techno on the prow through cave actually bailing out they're actually leaving this sa like this techno though no backs up into Tess and now the spanner into the works nothing they all be at least they've got some utility left on 910 maybe they can figure something out with that but it is looking very rough for the Mongols to close this half is almost surely going to be an 8 to Four score line for with heroic taking the lead awkward misread there I feel like wait waiting techno waiting for his team to get at least in position to trade that could have been far more effective for the Mongols but they thought they had a free sight now it's anything but two CS here tesses and NS two of the top performers for hero have to hold the line n the wrong way right now they line up for Blitz and he breaks through no one looked no one looked into the cave Blitz was just walking in there there was no smoke there was no utility down he just got two free kills now Dexter moving in can't deny it and that's the bomb going down suddenly Mongol back into the better position and D are moving close needs his quick shot but he's blasted Away by the AK and it's just shush he must attempt it last round of this half but he gets double Peak by the Mongols who have a crazy Resurgence to round up this first half one high impact ground at the start of the half but nothing since Ro still yet to win a pitch the round let's see if they can change that nerds charging in towards mid it's a real fast round they've got donut control but there's two Defenders on this a bomb side third coming over towards CT very quickly first head shot in Tess has punctured now not comes out to the temple the fights are going down and it's Mongol coming out on top of almost every single one until kick and show that heroic still have a standing in this pistol a bom it's huge they've got a force bik confirmed into the next but kick out wants everything as he kicks into gear a 1 V one low HP 910 on the other side of this box and kicks got it locked in ing game leader steps up with a 1 V3 first half so wouldn't be surprised if we see it again here Blitz going with sees that Hugo don't see it a lot in CS2 he definitely don't 5 s's pretty goated let's see what he's got with it they're just walking they're doing their best impression straight through a Maino swings into two rifles and that might just be it might be the Noy Cricket coming out got a bit of a to it doesn't it and Blitz reminds us why it was once part of the game part of the Met Nice Shot I thought it was done it seems like it was but we're right back into this TS leaping off the ledge it's BLS to go down in mid and a 33 once again established as heroic should be closing no got away with that with the quick switch to the AK One V one and eventually Tess shows his might on the ma 10 excellent grenade as well that just slows him that takes half his health out and this this is what Yan was saying earlier you know bring it back to winning a pist round and getting a decent start in the half could have changed the story for Heroic right over on D two we're seeing that right now they have a competitive first half they w a pistol and they get a decent start and now they're in control of the game oh they essentially won both pistols just by winning out the forces in the first half and then winning the pistol here and converting so it couldn't have gone better really for hero in this map got a hero rifle on this Eco round but again the contact into b t all the way in and they find out too late here we goes T around the side oh techno anything else get this 5 for a second no because Tessa stays composed within the sight oh he saw him does he know it's a rifle cuz 910 will very willingly take this fight he's got to kill everyone here in a essential 1 V3 inside of checking is back and the bomb crosses in you got on default cave and coming up the round at the same time there feels like heroic are sending us quickly to a map three of course we do have one full by from Mongols coming up but truly been in this map this will confirm Mirage and we're all excited about that yeah that's a great map for the Mongols as well so we have dust to ancient Anubis Mirage in the season close this one is looking very likely now that they will T and dster leading the way with nurs who is at the top with 17 and n n 10 B that hero rifle he's down on a shotgun right now look at this speed look how fast they're going into this B bomb site nerds at the front of the attack looking to bring some pain to this defense of Mongols senu tries to plug the Gap and M to step up monstrous hole for the Mongolian so far de are left 1 V5 Damage Done onto the first and closed on the second now three players still left and dxer takes another step in the right direction but night out it's the XM 1014 tow his dream yeah it's ballsy as Bal KNE out when you think Mongols are going to stop peing you they never stop but with this Trifecta of Dexter tesses and NS all firing think the entry power is certainly there they're going to let the orer K with the AK great work Tessa peing with him as well five on four S conceded BL coming in from middle and sure him and M can both help out but they've lost complete control of the sight some span could be nice but it's a long PA you won't stop that Tess gets a second entry kill dener joins the freight again and they are getting slaughtered until I blink and I miss it two on Five back to a two on two in an instant MHO knows he knows he has to deal with the on the ramp but he goes back to it but Dam that has to be finished off by 910 but nurse still alive and he's coming through cave it's the full 10c stick from 9 to 10 it's the full 10 second stick and he stopped it NS just comes around at the right time but lack of Kit lets him down and heroa right here on the edge of taking Mongols M pick and it feels like it's right there for the taking through the smoke flexing for dster he's looking for a third tessers and Dexter this has been a darly duo in the last couple of rounds just great to see heroic not get swept up in the energy of this first map when the whole room was screaming for Mongols when the dominant enough game came in that you think Mongols have a chance to run away with this series for have absolutely turned it on its head and look to show that they are here for a reason as well half a million dollars on the line better pull out your best play and sensu will give it a go but he is likely walking to his death as four players for Heroic stand on the other side heroic will pick up ancient they will tie up this best of five grand final they're here to play and that is a strong showing yes absolutely Hugo he heard BL you know we've heard his prediction and he thinks we're going into heroics lead to 2-1 after this into Mirage where Mongols have to battle back and try and force this into five TS off to a good start it's a head shot on towards 910 and a five to four player count currently favor heroic and it's going to look like it's going to continue because that push from shush is certainly going to help matters MHO getting involved in the action and back and forth it will go but keeping heroic up our nerds and dakes are two of their hardest hitters leaving techno alone perhaps now it is the number two because he's got four angry looking players on the other side he's got a face against you going there doesn't look like he's going to get a step closer to winning this one they're not giving him anything lined up as well with the bomb USB pick up is good idea but just not conceding a kill and there it is locking a pistol starting to get better and better can very much Capt people off guard if they don't swing mid fully know blit on C side loves to swing mid that will be later heroic fighting towards dark instead m going to take the H senzu close tries to run back not allowed not today never 9 10 dropping into the water but I think that's CAU a glimpse it's going back in and nin 10 ready make the most of this peak into the dark area and no nerds he stands strong 23 now from behind they PE into them and one of them was low so that could have easily become a double for techno ends up being blitzed left in this 1 V2 with 35 seconds left in play seeing a very aggressive heroic right now just you reacting to the info swinging it together they do it in dark they do it at long they're coming for the kills here and n's putting on a great start to this game but like you said very low Health could be cleared it's a good off angle at least if Blitz is going to keep sneaking he might walk right into this one for nerds 6 and0 right now Blitz falling off the ledge still catches a kill low Health now as the favor Falls to kicks some the bomb plant and time to disengage for Blitz he could go anywhere that plant long is his best bet but kicks and smoke molly flash as long as he doesn't fumble With Grenades and get peaked this is a very difficult round for Blitz to win however smoke Blitz has an HG so maybe that balances out has arrived deploys the utility smoke could to go down now as well he's got a flash to throw it into the mixes and Blitz does he Peak with this grenade this could be it this could be the round he comes off the defuse and he got around the corner all the time it's not on kickside he gets the kill but he got the time no he does not kick that drawn out and it's Blitz that picks it up for the Mongols flash going in follow up sh goes forward goes into the fight and it works out for MHO and senzu two for two but they know there's numbers now committed towards a they going to go through Cameron knowing it's just D left here just D I say but he's got one kill and a lot of damage off on that second player even able to disengage as well this plant isn't even safe cuz of the smoke they have to tap it they're a little bit scared he's going to come through but that just buys time for her to get set up for a quick retake in a man Advantage climbing in behind the smoke tesses coming ever closer at 910 kissing on oh inside of the smokes the kiss of death though as Tess picks him up and a second fire down at Heaven it is the response for Heroic and dster is the man that steps up when they need him most that triple A push is great but like you said Mongols immediately react as they should and run into camera I can't believe Dex is able to pick a player so feels like a camera split still shush dter should be absolutely good to just keep control of a it was going one for one kicks in on an off angle here smoke comes in and they somehow hit the turn around de with a lot to do and nothing to do a with for the awp gets one shot off can't blink back in time ASO runs him down and that's the round you know we've seen a few moments from dxer in that very position with the awp ready yeah you definitely have to be ready for a Dexter moment there because he was staying alive he's doing a pretty good job at the lane but in the end it's Mongols and just lining up that timing where he knows how who knows where they're splitting splitting him from missing one shot though that's all it takes oh dear oh dear indeed nice grab at the end for n he'll keep his AK seven and one take the hit for the MP9 as he does it again here he's got plenty UT D is going to get the or out 910 looking for the first fight did is he going to get the kill though yeah he will Tak too far open that right eye a little further out 910 will take him out of play straight away and now they got con control as well with that deep smoke s can just sit in here they could even get grouped towards be feels like it's going to be a b fake dou a main push at the same time so many options available for the Mongols with this 5 on4 you see the bomb s Lio between the two right now seeing which sight seems more favorable once these fights go down is going to come through techno catches another has two de to B but are they ready for sure she's off on an island right now behind the obisk still takes one more with him bomb staying focused towards B it's gone Sil the no they haven't seen anything a either so now he's starting to realize coming back to the B bomb side so smoke that is a sick maneuver from sh he actually just jumped he committ this and if he had more bullets he had another kill yeah just kicks it now no kit been in this one before Blitz is not going to make a mistake this time he just crosses in gets a stick for MHO as well Kon has great timing that's all he has though as he catches with the element surprise kicks and takes them both down dear oh dear M just standing in the open being able to convert some advantageous situations lot of Trades though right they're going for double pushes not always going to get the first kill but get the trade that's what you're there for players willing to sacrifice themselves for the great good this is a b pop right now through the molotop for the Mongols is going to get that shot off smokees down but there's a gap over the top of it Tess is trapped out with no support techno comes in with the kill well the Cavalry has arrived quite quickly here heroic have three remaining players close to the B bomb site but plant is in Mongols are drop back and look at this from dxer going through the smoke it disappears for a mere moment as the sniper begins to try and chime in but he's held behind a gray screen and techno Landing a head shot has forced the hand of heroic into the save nerts two 57 now you want to see nerds when there's rifles around but you know he's still very capable with it would you drop him yeah respect me personally as a terrible card yes of course I oh 91 good oh another one Mongol yeah they're sailing the victory right now for a fourth round that is two clean openers and uh he starting to build up the idea that hero might be able to do something even with some of the weaker weapons in play and that gets shut down immediately Tess is close to this mid smoke it FES away but it spotted and it's another Kill from Mongol untraded by heroic oh they just keep pushing right keep trying to trade out Mongols win every single one patience pays dividends two on Five now and Dexter nothing given that just going to group for this B split Mongols with a great chance of forcing a fifth if Mongols win here then they have Mirage up next and that's when they can close this yeah oh God everyone knows yeah and N will just force it I like that don't wait for them to come to you you go oh almost give thanks to another millisecond maybe he hits it there but n ain't getting out of here Mongols a lot of casualties but worth its way in Gold to break the money completely of heroic flash set up around the corner Blitz does not need it he just goes dry will he spam kicks Sam will he spam the door yes he will what yes he will techno follows up two clean kills from the Mongols and that's the big brain of Blitz Hugo that's where it comes from shush able to follow up with one back on MHO careful don't want to give away too many one v1s here just trying to control this they need to come in for the kill before they think about the P he pushed forward a nice attempt but senzu well played to back all the way up kill off the plot perhaps both as Tess flies in from Heaven it's a two on two how long will NS hold Blitz catches him by surprise and now Tessa's got to do it on his own with no kits no kid he deploys the smoke and now he could just stick it screw it the 10c stick from T sto by senu through the smoke these have looked tantalizing today [Applause] good one they're in a boo don't worry no no 40 seconds hero moved away off of a anyway so going into the sa boss that's going to be techno with the first head shot of this round and there might be more where that came from but it's mzo set forward this little Mongolian monster ready to RIT to the them up with him beautiful beautiful from the Mongols that's a Despicable spray there from M we've been waiting all day a great CT side for Mongols we know how strong they are in the CT side we've seen that in particular and it's fantastic to see mozinho in particular pop off in the last round of the first half because he was an anchor on the a bomb site one that was just immovable at times oh my God the drop down they know now they know now they're going for the be split so senu is putting a lot of distance between himself and dark technocore trying to take a fight towards main but it's still still the pistol coming up top TRS for Mongols finding some clean head shots 32 senu took damage back to the platform immed to be perfect and he punctures sho's head it's now kicks on left alone now he had a pistol clutch in the first half if you recall over on Ancient rather and now he's got a chance to come back around the C but 910 he's got his scent he has this idea what a he hunts him down and he's locked in that head shot Mongols have the pistol they continue their run of rounds three head shots of senzo one HP as well just absolutely Nails him to the wall lot of Molotov left to stop the hit again might tested but that's an aggressive entry for Blitz that's what he's capable of out through the window down onto tesses and retreating back to safety on the a bomb site with his teammate of MHO at the back of the cage it's fantastic for mzo takes a step up and elevated position removes the life of nurs kicks and held back by utility doesn't want to go alone with the ball anyway waiting on the rest of his teammates to make their moves ster is going to join him kick out now starts to go it's Mao to fall but remember Blitz is still here he's last spotted at middle but now he's here inside the sight blz brutalizes deer he's worried about the camera possibility because sent here from Heaven to cover off M and Sho now stuck in mid 19 seconds left bomb down towards Main and everybody's scrambling you low on the Mongol side but it doesn't matter there's too many targets and Mongols just keep racking Round Up to round up you brought this up you go you know heroic do have a great idea when it comes to the economy they're leaving just enough here and this could still be potent as they charge in at the sight o nice entry a lot of nades here and some low players to worry about Blitz does anything but worry picks another one out tenu not even awaiting his team they're just keeping the pressure on right now smoke will buy a bit more time but hero aren't going to get anywhere with it Dexter wants to go through on the fade there just too many CTS you'd think kicks and trades back needs a head shot 910 disallows and that's another round for the Mongols it's costly it's close as a bom plant but they're still coming [Applause] in trying to keep this or honest little flash but 910 doesn't get good right back for it I like that L smoke thrown out from water he's able to walk out of con and put pressure on Miss shot only a leg say gets anry into B in the meantime none of this matters unless Mino Falls and heroic now have an open path into this sight forget T they don't need him right now it's Blitz against the world and the world says enough and techno pinned inside of B so finally that streak comes to an end nine in a row though not a bad hle yeah definitely not just as they're about to reach map Point her prevent him from getting there now still a long way back for hero they've got a huge streak on this T side but 11 to six yeah need all the money they can get despite this little streak on the CT side of four it's not like they have unlimited funds so this will be one buy for the Mongols they should definitely go for it just to reset but it's not going to be perfect here comes the push up ouch silenced by techno not even really seen this to be honest right they've been very aggressive towards a main for the most part but this is what they were doing against uh 3D Max the other day Double B pushes Deni head shot clipped he was close to that he was close to that second right there D he's going forward he's blood holding down and can he get a second no he gets traded by nerds who continues to push forward into the bomb and Dexter does get his followup chance bomb is down far away from the play forward from nerds it's a very broy round right fights on both sides at the same time but anyone can take it from here NS has crept in behind the pillar but it's night pushing forward with the awp Against the Grain DEA don't count him out of a clutch on BS side of nubis he was just waiting to see what nurse could do he was just biting his time in that corner knowing that he has the bomb on his back so now it's on to him to make the play it's just a very you know you're in the dark you have no idea what's going on and Blitz is about to end it anyway unless DEA hurries around the corner Blitz didn't see him no he didn't but he knows he's on the track he can smell his prey as Blitz moves into that b bomb site a single sound CP from Dexter ends the round but they're rapping and they're wrapping some more just think of how many possible positions dxer has to worry about at this point 910 still looking into it a tap on the plant stopped by Blitz and it is won by the [Applause] Mongol hero waiting behind numerous smokes and Mongol just make the gamble they're not coming a 10 to four first close to Landing his Target now techno goes in with an EMP KN but look how he sees three but he can't seize his chance and it's all crumbled here for the Mongols it is just Blitz the only player to get a kill and now the only player Left Alive it is 12 to7 heroic not letting this one go just yet there is no way simply and you can hold your breath for a really long time impossible no it's not happening surely unac now hold it and Dex does deny it okay I I admire it I admire it that would have been one way to close the the map wouldn't it not going to happen couple of fan bases could learn a thing or two Tes into the water and push out B with two Blitz and senzu in space and that's the rifle gone the most important weapon the most impactful weapon his hand but picked up by techno and oh he actually wins that fight he didn't seem super sure on whether it was left or right side robbed right like he was checking both of them there so techno able to put it to use armorless but still Keen to make a use of it and senzu position completely Unknown about so luckily enough for kicks and he won't go into a stack 910 is the only player hero and this deagle tucked in the corner of Heaven he would need to land a banger and unfortunately for him it is not that case it's MHO charging with the 57 usually so good with it but clean kills from heroic no one going down in that initial a play and it is the ninth round we have politicized nice chance here got a little scary for what you thinking about Buddy what were you considering hopefully now it's a save cuz we got a full by coming up next get a bit of extra money perhaps for the awp mentioned before this is a team that likes double op especially on this map s been known to pull it up from time to time even seeo done it oh bit i' got bad news senzu yeah he'll just lie in the bag of beans let's keep them back at a they are starting to move forward with that mol oh it's actually separating MHO from his teammate they severed each other off and nerds always going to have to deal with it he drops further back and MHO he's still going yeah that's a dirty repul from n you don't see that he wants the push and he might still get it there's still two players in a m but they actually back off thinking maybe this is the a hit it's anything but got to convert a 4v5 here Mongols feels like it's full control now for Heroic they fall to three 35 seconds left TS in the fight against techno techno takes too much damage on board but still gets that kill 30 seconds bomb could it's got one option now really leaving and you got to commit you got to commit to this plan now and I think with 20 seconds left it starts to get a little scary but techno's going to go down and now senu a middle trying to slow things down and they do get the kills they get the round elimination but yeah that could have been a little scary I mean they didn't want to go away but Nur is like guys I just triple entry you kind of need to bring the bomb now why take it into the stack why take it into the last two players on B we know we there oh my God techno takes a risk oh yeah this is nice from techno he's got that kill will he be traded no he won't because tesus is out of ammo and techno oh he's sticking around he went you really want more you really want more and that grenade close to taking out his opponent that lies he's just going right through senu had to Tred in from and he goes again he goes to the it's another one from senu D through in the chaos catches one player unaware and now we're looking at a 2v2 with blitz coming back through con Mol not effective solo one it but it's m moving through the Mong they are staying in this but D down into the one V1 Blitz on the other side at the pillar gets by D sees him and it's not overtime it is the Mongol they were close to collapse but Mongolian blood is strong they stay in this and they are two one up in the B5 plenty of words down here and plenty of maps of Counter Strike at this best of fight perhaps we have even more here go Mongols on the tside on the CT side but the Mongolians set their sights on their second title of 2024 and they could win it here on Mirage and this room has not shut up not since the start of the series right even in wins and losses in the halftime in the postm breaks they've been screaming up a storm got a bit of a storm into this be side right now Tech with an entry but there's plenty of CTS in position Four Strong right now and they're all finding kills 910 stuck in the apartments could peek out on the car kicks going down but Nur making sure but it's going to get out of hand at all Blitz stuck it short and yeah this round is Sur careful surely over but the bomb is so far away from Blitz that is the problem right he's got a lot of ground to make but at least he has the time Hugo Tess is low but tucked in in a perfect headshot position blit gets closer NS not spotting just full tucked makes sense for NS to B bait Tess is a bit in this position be unknown as he oh his head poked over the top he got the info Blitz has been spotted now two digs two low players where's Tess gotten to there he is right in time with three kills Tess takes the pistol for Heroic all right full by for Mongols not a lot of util here due to the deagle buys it's Mirage just need those clean head shot and senu follow them n shows us how it's done with a double up straight into short techno smoked out but we've been seeing a prity push these all series long and it goes both ways Kon Trad position okay they just walk right past each other K's going to find the bomb though if he keeps going someone has to come here they want to win this off kills oh he'll miss it completely and techno will miss him again as he backs up now they think it's a this is so weird techno running techno running back to get that bomb Kick s already taking a fight and connector and he's lost it to senzu a so the bomb is going back to the a bomb site now for finish and it will be the first round on the board for the Mongols just a flurry of kills early in Middle yeah no utility no need just double entries they're going to put a lid on it ex stops blit in B heroic still a chance to pull this back but dter hanging on to the AK no no I don't know if [Music] yeah Mongols a far more methodical take of middle this time it's blowing the smoke to fight mid but he takes a lot of damage there did not go to plan Tessa spams and finds one instead oh how's bullet into the window he's going to slip through the murder hle and get it way into spawn with 48 seconds left get the be hit in b backstab and here it comes MHO and techno going in towards B kickand taking steps further away from that smoke as it begins to fade away let's see what Blitz is capable of pulling off here he's got eyes on short he's waiting on his teammates to come out of the apartment 30 seconds left here for the mon he's got a kill on Kick will he get the one on dster no the op steps up and he still has a chance to win this round for a side but he got by his crossair and techno into the B bomb site dxer down and that was the only way oh felt like Dex absolutely could have won that round there it's still up for the task here for Heroic but no kit puts them on the clock n is wide out already trying to look for this fight on short but the smoke is a problem boost over Instead This smoke really is a problem he off they hear him coming they know there's one more now ner stuck behind this wall 910 takes him out he going to be Mongols doing right by the flank of their Captain Blitz getting through the window Mongols see enough they P it off wait for the under player me while entry out of ramp and he just disappears back through that smoke huge opening kill but ner is still here trying to kick up dust in their face top mid they have no idea sentu swings the fight short and surprisingly catches a freebie double kill for senzu in Middle puts Mongols 5v2 just takes her kicks out with no real fight left some clean starts in these rounds man ever since the guns came out they got that 3K in Middle where it fell pretty much over and similar story here in this one yeah just no survivors and no casualties it's a really impressive start here from the Mongols heroic got the awp off for dster we talked about how much of a difference maker that can be he's looking into mid early but there's no real presence coming this way just one player Crossing out top M and that's senzu he's already got by that smoke but look at this NS is close NS is so close and senzu is ready for that fight the jum the sound and Sen's got the opening he actually got some damage off but senzu still out on top it's literally the sound q that loses NS at fire otherwise he's good for it there wush timing as he checks his back it goes from bad to worse to in a hearse for her they just can't deal with the opening power of Mongols and you mentioned this earlier this is a team that don't mind disrespecting utility going through smokes making timing plays and they just felt it they go through that Palace smoke just watching ramp Mongols and heroic both punishing any attempt at a save s who crouched in be apartments for crying out loud it's not going to get much better for you they lose another gun Dexter just fighting for his life in this sight and it's not going to come easily oh my God s what a pre-fire that techno here is's the tag D was gone money's gone no awp oh it is so tough does feel J no one's overstepping at the moment kicks and jump spotting b or trained on connector shush having trouble one and eight again he's had some really unlucky rounds though and here they come upsh Tess's caught with NAD out right now they just entry him like it's nothing running past the spam into the B side kicks in looks out short shot comes in from 910 that's another followup kill here for the mon NS doing what he can but so much more required of him and dster he's got eyes on the site bom PL going in ner got blasted away but that grenade by techno and now a 3v2 with [ __ ] still ahead and that flank coming in Blitz he's still a long way off I mean he's all the way back at the a bomb site and he's actually he knows they're saving so he's just going to try and cut them off there's no they haven't been able to save any of these rounds they call off the humanity at least D got us off right but for now he does yeah he's swapping off he's not he doesn't even feel safe he could have run back through Market they've come Double Cat and Dex is going to have to fight if he wants any gun in that next round cuz they are right here oh gone everything removed no mercy from the Mongols yeah give him a break right now but the wheels are falling off right now this wagon deagles some smokes an M4 on Dexter not even saving for the or he wants to take matters into his own hands and try and win a round we need a hero play he's giving it to us but techno happy to oblige trade some damage out meanwhile they're getting closer on catwalk oh head- onhe head battle right here around this corner it's all come up Mongols wow every fight is won by the Mongols it is brutal they cannot stop the Mongolian horde that keep charging into the bomb site shush and nerds waiting around the smokes denial of the ball plant the follow up from the de and remember Blitz is also low so there's still a chance because sh is but another chance but no head shot oh he's got another this is so sick from Sho but finally stop but he tees up nurs he tees up his teammates to close out on the hard work done by that deagle and there is a shot for three here n gets close in the sight and senzu takes a moment to just drop back he could have gone anywhere nerds has no idea but senzu has not moved has bited his time in the safety of the van and now nerds knows where his next victim is the MP9 is rapid to kill especially with only 42 Health but that number is evened out now nurs is down on 42 and he's on the other side but the spin from senu that head shot loost this kid is the future of Asian Counter Strike they just can't miss they really just cannot miss and I don't know if hero have the gumption to pull this game back you don't need smokes you got head shots smoke him if you got [Applause] him Tessa saw them he knows they're down low walking through the smoke is he aware of a second player Tessa has traded in the meantime N1 has the scope ready to go and they're going to creep into what is an MTA site because Sha's attentions are currently drawn into towards mid in the bottom of connector and that free up a completely sh is going to walk looking the wrong way and techno is just waiting waiting for the head shot to come in ches in from short bomb Loose as well they have to pick it back up quickly but it bu a few seconds for kicks him with a kit to come in through spawn it's going through jungle instead Dex just get doed kon's got to burn his Smoke on the molotov set a light in Jungle and how can he survive this round this is looking like a 10 round streak for the Mongols and nothing is being given to the captain of heroic a team that has had trouble a team that is choked under the pressure right now performing when it matters most kicks him on the clock a missed shot but it won't be enough to let him back in Mongols f 10 rounds in a row on the tside of Mirage the Talon pool definitely runs deep in Mongolia and heroic a final chance presented in the form of a pistol round to pull this game back great shot from nerds needs more than that 910 oh got spotted but doesn't matter still able to react fast enough to bring NS down before everybody turns their retentions towards the window now Tess is just waiting for the time to come out of Palace but he's been spotted now and so no longer has the element of surprise in at range these USP should absolutely destroy them Mao again monstrous with that USB it's just one in the connector and it is surely done now with a pistol round win the Mongols take a huge leap forward to becoming Champions here in Berlin go slow and steady will not win this race as Mongols are sprinting to the Finish Line bom in to there surely can't be a commitment I mean we have a lurker in pal we have players walking con this is all a fake out right now and Muggles haven't panicked they've stayed sto two in the sight first kill for 910 nurse to fight back Blitz with another one followed up for the Mongols and is deagle still from the top of the stairs proves potent but MHO makes sure that that tra comes in and it drops heroic to just two players yeah Dex just walking through a smoke right now just hiding in the corner M wants to bring the fight to him this could be it heroic 32 on the cards Dex sneaks right past him but we know where this is going Mongols V heroic and it's heroic who get anen battered on Mirage the venue is filled with the thunderous gallops of the Mongolians we've got the sanus ceremony and the ERS to give that Chalice on over to the Mongol the thunderpick world champions 2024 it belongs to the mighty Mongols [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
