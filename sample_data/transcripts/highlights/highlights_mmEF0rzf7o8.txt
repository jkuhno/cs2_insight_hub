oh yes that's right it's time for the semis here at the last ever blast Premier World Finals a completely P Arena it's ready for the best town ofri players on the planet to lock horns and battle it out for a $1 million priz pool Singapore I hope you're ready for another serving of D two chaos it's time to lock in it's time for Vitality versus G2 Let's Get It On oh Hunter he wants to get this on already up middle right here ch ing Jack to stand in strikes first slows things down good Flash oh taken down Nico early on nice Advantage for Vitality here but they slow things down the Des talked about it these 5 v4s they have been pivotal for both of these rosters one player towards the back of B that's going to be snacks it's a good position but it looks likely to be a splits flashbang towards shorts they need information they need to shut this down can Mony strike yes he can to so immediately from Moni evens things out and vitality they've been blindsided but still they want to execute their plan flash out Jax he's taking a peak right now he's looking for something but it looks like Vitality they're actually High tailing it to be that is where snack is on and out he's going to step up the captain of G2 under so much scrutiny a second kill for stack looking for the third he gets it what a recovery that was going to be playing with this bonus by the utility though it's not great but looks like we're going to get that late long take Molly though with a Feet of Flames he wants to bust on out spots one target takes him a while to find him but mes is taken down that is long control in the favor of Vitality and they're already fighting back o long Mony with the head shot though evens it out here we go then he's getting in his Zone a dangerous Prospect for Vitality double head shot with the Scout locking them in can he get a third upgrades to the B9 Retreats back towards the BB side itself going to focus his efforts towards long jackon is waiting on the other side as Mony sits in the Smoke his teammate will go down three versus two Advantage but Mony can still save the day here Maui oh Jax he's got a seeking feeling and no it's not good enough though Mony right there continues his efforts oh long range head snack is not able to follow up Spinx puts him down and vitality are on the board TTS now will be guessing what's going on do they react they try and gets some territory elsewhere knowing that short has been compromised execution is possible here this looks for for a contact play smoke goes down flashes over it's Nico to defend can he Step Up can he find the first Mony will be there with the awp as well needs to find multiple kills here being surrounded being pin and it's going to be mesty starting to connect with the or three versus three Long Way spray doesn't connect for ni and now they're in a lot of trouble here snacks and Hunter on the retake as the bomb gets planted Hunter right behind the smoke right now here's the bomb plant might not be aware of his position just yet okay flash on forward nice shot from him but no this is just clinical from Vitality you're looking so good but the HP it is low snacks There's an opportunity they've spotted him at this point okay A little bit of a head that's a pixel right there Apex doesn't want to give him another opportunity he takes the shot hits it himself okay some very close rounds there but G2 have been broken good efforts I got to bring this up Henry go on just how close these two teams have been all year and in the final decision for world number one these results matter in front of a crowd zyu versus Monas hunting for that hltb top one player and on top of that they are close together Spinx longrange shots making it look so easy right now oh Spinx okay I think he's almost with the ace right here Apex he wants it he's taking out yeah he wants to get in on this okay now Spinx he's coming back for it there we go Spinx with the ace right there man he has been just so clean against pistols in the last couple days ah it's true against M yesterday he completely dominated lot of spam being thrown through that smoke okay they're going to finish up towards B here you can see there four players in towards the tunnels they have someone watching the extremities towards Shore showing a little bit of presence zyu to cover them as they slowly but surely make the contact play towards the B bomb side snacks tucked in Hunter to bait and they seem to know they seem to be aware of the prospect the first leg shot is here and it's going to be snack can he find multiple kills not this time significant damage Mony keeps the round alive he gets three snatches the round away as Apex towards middle needs a double kill won't be expecting Nico and what a recovery once again they make it work with the Lesser weapons and that is why people have him as their world number one takes it back by force every single opportunity that was presented to him he hits the shot Nails it this jumping shot right there on a Spinx is so clean and even while getting tagged right through the wall is able to straight outou to take down zyu as well Onan Wrecking Crew G2 are going to try to disguise where his whereabouts are every single round always keep Vitality guessing here we go toward that a bombs side once again trying to test Mony and that's not the maneuver you want to present Apex goes down cleanly and now do they want to continue their push Bops deployed trying to get control of the a sight Nico send his presence towards Middle with flames not dissuaded he'll happily push in he'll happily make his way in towards the side itself Hest he tucked away in a more defensive Mana here they have got control of a 35 seconds and the CTS are on through three players retaking from CT spawn flashbang deployed and here we go snacks at the tip of the spear flashbang successful can they open things up here mobs first up Jax takes him down nice shot from him and zyu with the defense from the back line Jack still looking for the shot unable to find it Nico with two kills in quick succession though now they're pressuring onto the site there is a little bit of utility left on the side of Spinx but he pushes the smoke himself great TR from Spinx Nico trying to close things out and it's against zyu 18 HP one shot that's all it's going to take and Nico right here two seconds oh great shot from Nico giving Vitality a parting gift on his farewell [Applause] tour it's good it's good good air quality today oh a little bit low the aggression mix things up it's going to be Hunter joined by Mony down here they Overlook his position but he is flashed and taken down Mony will have to make it work with the tech 9 my God does he ever keeps the dream alive here and snack has made a great maneuver the fact he's got upper B under his remit there's a chance he could really devastate Spinx he won't expect that sort of push there's no way snack has got Vitality in a choke hold right now they just don't know it this is huge oh this is going to be a freeb oh he's moving away this actually lowers the efficacy of the MP9 of course and this makes it a pretty difficult kill actually oh he's just going to wait oh he's waiting for it he's waiting for it the Vitality rotation is coming back in but he might just have to pull the trigger on this one doesn't look like there's any Target took a little while a little bit worrying there was an opportunity for Spinx but still Advantage lies with G2 we take it all day long nice work snacks there fantastic push towards the B tunnels gets himself tucked in t spawn three versus two Mals this time defensive towards the aide itself one kill would secure the win in round number nine here and it's an absolute beauty of a shot need to try and stay alive zyu definitely going to be dangerous in this scenario Burns away mouths 42 and the bomb on his back and of 30 points of help himself but that won't be a factor he can hit the first head shot here on Nico needs to be the head shot oh but it's Nico that finds it closes it out for G2 in that one what a great push from snacks and that's exactly what I was talking about in the round prior and vitality I mean this is your pick you got to get something going in this half four rounds could be okay but we need this man with the awp right here that is true Henry zyu needs to join up six kills only okay Nico fight early on and the spray is there for one Apex gets the return Ms right around the corner of the smoke oh jumping through and Ms is able to still hold on the tracking is so strong for this player right now and on top of that the utility puts Flames into the dirt wow the long take not successful whatsoever it's a four versus one spin the only player that's been performing to a high level 15 kills short five of those are against that was quick he rolling back in years Maui he's trying to break that streak and a beast looking very likely they've been dissuaded now after snack has shown some good form but he's got the AK-47 and still a lot of utility hands it over to Hunter nice grenade chip damage towards ja here and snacks in a prime position Maui he could tap away and find multiple kills here the best weapon for the job as well he wants Hunter to take the initial Agro here he comes lovely work one more kill would do it he's looking for the hatrick he gets three and Hunter guarantees the round Apex nothing to do nothing to say he recovers the bomb but he is taken down it's the first half going in favor of G2 9 to3 two players towards lower zyu he needs to get activated for Vitality to have a chance in this one this would be a good as round of round is any right there in the corner oh decoy actually Still's able to hit the spray right there mon with two immediately though G2 are so good with these decoys but Mony doesn't need anymore three kills already flames and Jax the two lone members but Ms he's already searching towards long a already taking some space away Mony he's been a menace in this round wa away to cap it off then finish off the final two still trying to hold on to this position even with a mind zwu kill it's nowhere near enough four on two still possible to some extent but apparently not another Ace is on the cards on the agenda as ja is thrust in to an impossible scenario Mony now up to 18 kills seven deaths and now another race available to him you know he's going to get it at range of four there pops the final head it's an ace yes Mony right there showing off so much skill the flashes the decoys all of it setting him up the bodies as well taking down his counterpart in zyu on top of it what a beautiful sequence for monesy there this was just so clinical he is on another level right now dominating zwu making him look average pedestrian flames in tow Apex yeah he knows he needs to will his team into this round he might not be aware of a player in pit at this point you have to assume it self flash is there swing ah no dice nothing yeah this is still looking possible I'll give them that Apex applying nice pressure the Scout he hits a couple more tags his MP9 might be able to be set up smokes down there's the first kill now it's MD though with the double looking to secure the victory the CT still fighting back two versus two now Spinx keeps the dream alive low HP for Nico and he's left in a very dicey situation but there was a player to pull this one off it could be Nico but no he is denied 11 to4 as Vitality keep their head above water with the force spy with the MP9 and Scouts Spinx and Apex Inspire hope here for Vitality they're going in for a push towards upper as well CTS hunting for information towards long we will find the first kill and zyu slowly but surely coming to life here he finds double digits in round number 16 and they've got the man Advantage down but not out vitality fighting back here showing some character showing some guts as we'll see an a execution once again already space taken Apex rotates on in he'll be connecting with zyu who's on the platform right now Monas is going for the contact play quick on the trigger Apex though lies in weight to ramp this might be a surprise to the players on G2 and oh Apex great spray with the Famas Nico takes him down in return Flames is there and snacks 1 V3 nice shot to kick things off and he's got a little bit of space to work with he's got some space he's got some time and he is feeding it today currently had 12 kills and seven deaths he's got the bomb plant is a nice long plant as well Maui he can get towards the pit he opts not to there is a player flanking from long and is going to be spins the standing Jacks with the MP9 towards short they've got kids they've got all the utility they could ask for snack has not got a good position for this fight at all I don't think he can pull this one off spotted and taken down needed a stronger position than that I like the idea the long plan getting towards a pit I think that's the only way Z and we'll see what they've got up their sleeve snack has called for a b play here wow I don't think it'll be the rush but maybe an execution we'll see what they've got in mind okay he might want to go off the contact of Vy presented an opportunity but completely blind during it okay is there a double swing here Mony don't give him a chance like this nice shot from him leing Spinx solo Defender Of The B bomb site 16 HP okay Vitality already shuffling over and once again maybe peeling off here man are they still going to going to force this there's so much utility that keeps flying at them it feels like Vitality are signaling they know that you're in Tunnel right now doesn't matter they're still going for it Z back at the site was one and Spinx with 16 HP is's able to stand up to find two Mony not presented an opportunity zwu right there with the jiggle and Mony oh he can't connect with the shot ah 4 HP and it looks like Vitality have held on to this one G2 they were stuck in the B tunnels they took no map control anywhere else they wanted to fight through all of that utility from vitality and blew up right in their faces it's a fumble of leadership there they couldn't decide where they wanted to go no execution essentially a contact play with bad spacing trying to use that L smoke and it doesn't work out for them whatsoever needed to be more decisive needed to have the game plan and now Mony hoping he can hold on to the awp we needs to be careful though he's only got four points of Health looks like the sniper will be his they are trying to find him in TPA but uh he's got more than enough time to survive that was disappointing from G2 opening pick Ms with no grenades whatsoever and Flames looking more confident as he hits n kills now oh look at the smoke it segments so much of long a I mean it really just says we know you can be in that corner we can hard clear you mobs he doesn't check it the smoke is made exactly for that okay that's that feels like an error in using the utility around you there got that smoke at least give it a check right yeah there there's that is exactly what it's there for Nico's low they've missed a m to be smoke that's all they have they going to have to go for the contact play and what a flick that is from ZW starting to find his form and Spinx he's locked him out of the B side here there is a slight chance Mony and Nico a tantalizing Prospect but zwu will give them the man Advantage can Mony find the m point here bomb down and he has got a little bit of you here a couple of flashes to work with needs to cut this one down a size and find himself a one versus one CT is encroaching his position it's zwu with the retake on the awp Flames towards the window AK-47 in hand as Mony waits he knows they'll be coming in together whe they both be entering through the double doors here first kill doesn't go in his favor taking heavy damage good effort but it wasn't quite enough Vitality the streak continues and another disastrous round there from G2 Miss [Music] smokes the smoke are you sh the well then I missed the smoke yes he did last words no lies to take and head foundy and Mals has somehow found a five versus three still a lot of work to be done with the pistols but they are going to find a couple of rifles on rout zwu a chance to continue his streaking on the CT side M will take him down and it looks like we got M Points the round with the pistols the rush towards Shore they find a gap they find some space and the awp is been recovered Ms can close things down here it's a standing Jacks with nothing to do nothing to say and that alleviates a lot of pressure Maui the round you don't expect to win they now have given themselves a nice bit of buffer they've at least got overtime here and nice cash injection as well hey whatever Taz said in that timeout it hyped him up can they close things out right here right now frustration setting in for sure mistakes presented time and time again but they have found map points on their opponent's pick much more classical take right here the default coming into play Molly on the oh wait Spinx just fights on right through the doors catches Mony off four on four situation though this isn't bad for G2 they like how the land is looking right now technically favors the tside here the four and four the midsplit looking likely once again not even the split just the midt segregated by the incendiary walled by Z's orb Nico is taken out of the equation what How's he done that are he I don't even think he saw him for a second there a pure wall Bang from zwu oh my goodness he's had enough Maui he was looking weak he was looking underwhelming and Hunter he keeps the dream alive at two versus 1 35 seconds but the bomb is down they'll have to jump down towards spawn I would assume and down he goes 30 seconds to work with here zood doesn't seem to be completely aware but of course he makes up for a check spawn and absolutely eviscerates the final player what a sequence zwu is online baby another four piece hat another four piece round from him smoke at the doors they just want to take this cat space safely they've had so much trouble with it with all the people that are fighting through the doors but this time they are granted safe passage a little bit of Gap in that smoke okay I smoke a little too soon SP is somehow able to find snacks but G2 they're going to take that igl down we can see Apex already rotating on in a minute remaining Hunter holds the extremities he'll pin him from short but it is going to be the long take Flames nice off angle though you might not anticipate this I think they just walk right by the angle yep oh he can't hit the shots oh no that's a disaster zyu now on an island four T's approaching they the first one he needed that looks like there's going to be a little bit of utility to support this play Z he busts out the deagle he goes right on the other side spots the barrel takes him down as well Mony in the back line sweating but hunter right there for the pinch no chance for zwu at that point but Mony he's got to get the bomb over there's 20 seconds left Hunter has to keep the bomb site in his team's possession Mony still trying to make sure that it's okay for him Hunter Nails Jax right in the face all leaving it down to Apex n sails out he's able to find the kill Hunter Mony on the site he's been a monster so far but aex trying to hit the jumping shot not going to connect slows things down finds out where Mony is a great jump spot a pixel spotted but Mony he knows exactly where Apex is it's fishion a bar and Mony takes him down to close the M 13- [Applause] 10 than a Singapore slots machine thus far this team I don't know what I'm getting mapped to map game to game tournament to tournament but they're looking Fierce here in Singapore Apex early on with the push Hunter not ready for the peak basy is though he's been ready for everything that has been thrown at him this entire tournament IU win the pit Jack on the site nades are coming out Monas is going to be mauling zwu out of that spot he's going to be burnning alive he has to vacate the premises tucks himself in aiit the flash is there zou on top of it it gets the first shot but no okay everybody is storing the bomb site mob with clinical incision as he gets on to a flames in the one versus three he's got some utility himself but no kit this is an uphill battle smoke is right in his face and he doesn't look like he's going to be getting back into this one case for a save here on this utility and he is going to op for that you're dead on as well the fact he has no klar as well three versus one a bomb the deuse no K all those variables working against him and he's got himself $500 worth of utility so yes definitely worth the save clearing out all the Cubbies it spins on the side the MP9 he has been phenomenal today Spinx has been the Beacon of Hope of Vitality when they were looking weak and flashbangs from CT spawn he does see this too often okay they're going to pop through the smoke Apex has got the flash ready Z with the swing oh actually a little bit of a team flash or maybe that was actually g2's now spings okay there he goes pops off the Apex flash but snack is there quick work of those aite Defenders Jackson the pit okay let's see what he's got he needs to be the Mesi replacement but overwhelmed by Hunter jumping right on top of him some nice shots here The Counter Strike spectacle so many skill players on the server right now Apex and Flame Zone looking out of their depth they might have to save the MP9 once more gal has been found that's not too bad a worthy upgrade as we all see them fall back here snacks getting it done yeah definitely know that you're going to be presented a duel early on zwu he's acting like this is an OP deagle down mid but yeah quickly Force off at the angle and once again snacks making his way up middle seems like a repeat of the previous round oh my yes he he is using it like an OP what a shot from zyu there a desert eagle but Jack without any ke as well snack is confirming that middle is at least clear for now and it two players stacked up towards the quad side snacks alone and trying to HT for information as they make their way back towards B beautiful shot from Mony that's the MP9 removed and 50 seconds what's the final play it looks to be a b split from Spawn snack makes his way through the smoke keeps things sneaky and tricky there are two bside Defenders zyw Flames got to come up big here and Z with his head tucked down this is going to be a free kill for snack yeah this is all day unless wait looking that direction hold on a second now they know exactly what's going on Mony fighting his way through it though there's no CT but it doesn't even matter shots are there but Flames comes up with two looking for the third oh just misses out on that opportunity what a way for G2 to keep themselves in this one as we enter the first gun Round We interesting to see where they position set the tone for the game here mols and grenades exchange towards B if zwu with the orb on the corner looks like he's more than ready for this Challenge and he'll find n to open things up here that's what Vitality needed down 03 in the hole Hunter will try to react find some space towards middle Spinx he's right there on the corner playing a timing game and it does not work in his favor but enough bullets were expended and so Jax was able to find the trade on the reload now Moni he's trying to make the same play happen smokes off that Arch side keeps Vitality in check keeps him honest Jax though he's already reacting I mean this is impressive stuff from a standing to be this proactive but it leaves Apex on an island the rotation is not there yet Jax he going to be quick on the flank but it might not be quick enough bombsite is being taken by G2 Molly right in front of Apex this is a clear line for him though easy shot on the snacks mobs know he has to deploy this smoke you need to get this bomb planted because once you do anything's possible when Monas he's in the back of the site here we go man Advantage but the bomb is down we got the CTS retaking from ruins CT spawn and banana Jackson that long flank Now read it but can't hit the shot Mony with a difficult clutch But Rising to the occasion an astonishing shot towards CT sport can he make this one work spot the player towards the coffins a great effort but it will be the first on the board there for Vitality we go three to one and bear in mind they lost a lot of players in that previous round to the deagles the money is not going to be fantastic quick on the flank that kind of reaction right there that's highle Cs and really again when you're the stand and you want to be the guy that doesn't make the mistakes but you know that you have to sometimes seize an opportunity a window and he did right there down again and we see that the force SP out from G2 but a chunky n onto four players right there really is going to soften them up another one on top of it insult to injury and it looks like they've already outlined what they want from this one Ms forcing the issue through the fire but it's Flames that takes him down man this is just an onslaught of utility and vitality are coming out way on top yeah tactical air strike there and it is is going to be the opening frag for Vitality they got to find versus four Hunter tries his luck towards the AP shows a bit of presence for the grenades continue to do so much as he goes down to 40 points of he Spinx knows he's low he's got a freebie here well played not quite going to convert it but key information regardless we're going to focus our efforts towards B now Flames has been pretty solid here so far he's got Apex with him as he actually goes down now they know a player towards CT sport got a swing got to find at least one which he has done they're so low the round should be secure still three versus three but a lot more complicated now we are going to see Nico get a prime position I think Z spotted him oh he did spotted a shoulder going to be a hard clear oh caught on the quick switch oh no okay this just unfolded so poorly for vitality and what was shaping up to be a master class in utility somehow G2 break their way into the sight bear in mind it's all unconfirmed damage we POV but they don't get the indicators that they've done about 300 damage down towards the bottom of banana they're assuming these players have HP to work with but they certain don't they know they're playing a dangerous game in those Halls yeah this is going to be a pivotal moment oh they could to have double swings on either side of the equation Maui and it will be the double kill G2 pretty much have guaranteed the round at this stage it would seek something disastrous from zwu he's unable to inflict any damage whatsoever and it's another freebie of a round open bomb site and save weapons is the only option now for Vitality Apex and Flames don't see any action whatsoever in this one uh Do or Die situation now Vitality need to start posting some form and showers they can keep up with the stand in they got to look for a way to flip the script banana control has been such a strong asset to the G2 game plan thus far despite all the utility damage they've been taking they are fighting through it and Flames he wants to contest this and if anything I mean this is a part of the defense that should be good for you but hunter okay he wants to pressure Jax immediately Jax ready though on the trigger regardless we have seen vit finding opening and they have been unable tot low Health but still plenty of utility it's hunted has gone down and go plug the Gap in towards the apartment so an a finish looking very likely I think mon is going to throw a little bit of a fake in towards B with a smoke in spawn some flashes and all presence but his teammates get ready and Ms might consider the pushing that smoke oh that's a death sentence if he does hesty hasn't even sold the fake H oh no that's a Miss smoke on top right there well Jack I mean there might be a timing but Spinx is covering the the Halls right there great shot lasers him right in the face and N this is looking awful for G2 right now you might even consider the save at this point one last ditch effort flash in the face of Jackson now it's an easy clean up no contest whatsoever well done from Vitality on the B bounc back here five alive and I will say like it's really just been G2 with great game planning no one's really popping off on the kill feed right now five kills a piece on four of their players Nico behind with four of his own and so really it's just been good team yes and oh no that's a lot of damage though God it burns out of smoke as well they were blind in the corner giving each other a cuddle and now they're both quite tagged up the grenade connects as well but so does the M4 of flames speak of witch running through the fire and he actually got the opening pick once again can they convert this one still don't want to fall back towards a bomb s you can see Z on the off angle of the awp has flames to swing out if required got to have a flash here G2 or this is a free kill hit looks like for the dry Peak all he needs is an elbow a shoulder and zyu still fighting on but no okay so much pressure here wait a second this round is turned on its head three versus three the Cavalry is on the way though spin's trying to recover the situation with amol off through it he's got the utility is there going to be a pop a flash Apex looks like he wants to send him right through he does flashes right there in his face and collects two kills leaving Mony in a dire one versus two but the nade right at his feet bye-bye what a moment Spinks calls for the flashbang dives through the smoke is that another smoke available as well it is Flames have still got a smoke in incend they should not be able to win this round uh they will be locked out be very challenging to say the least here to BU through this initial wave of utility there's the smoke right there 25 seconds he's going to be fading at 10 seconds remaining and Flames he's going to be playing right in front of that smoke good flash as well to support a this is just a completely decimation wait a second Nico with the head shot right through the edge of the smoke Apex still in the backline here supported by Z they got to connect right now to defend this be bomb typ but there's 8 seconds left but it might just be enough time Jax is quick on the flank Spinx as well and that is going to do it there is no time left Vitality win the round with yet again another master class in utility slows them down so much no opportunity to ever breach that bomb site cleanly Henry this was 61 I know this is looking great for Vitality this is a huge boost of momentum that they're getting flames again going to be fighting at the top of banana Nico takes him down six and six on the game not his best work just yet but it is space and we go there no messing around here in Apex though he'll catch a couple one through the smoke 61 down it looks at the captain might have tied things up for them but Vitality they're quick on the flank if Spinx even gets one it's over but if they qu kill him quick enough this could really unravel for Vitality M he's holding the flank and the timing there oh it's just perfect Apex executes two players M buys Lo but the lineup almost almost and vitality and the half with five in a row off the back of some greatly constructed CT rounds two players on a three man stack towards B for G2 it looks like they want to sell this fake though towards B okay monaz is going to have out a couple options right here and that's part of the utility gone already okay but the explosion starts out of the apartments it is dry but it does not matter Flames makes it look good that was a plan that was falling apart for vitality and yet Flames was able to deliver once he gets one kill there it's a very different round he can't find the head shot challenging shots but ones that aren't converted in Apex now he can hear everything around him he holds towards second middle waiting for his chance to pounce doesn't want to give this up for free honestly sentes something of foot but the timing eludes him as we go into a four versus one scenario poor old snacks nothing he can really do with this one I'm afraid he'll have 46 points of Health make it 32 and not a bad shot actually got three kills on the CT side of dust two in that pistol but would have to go one step Beyond here as the bombb expires he's got no Kip looking for anyone hanging around but he'll be getting blown up here with the blast hoping to bait someone back into it and take them down but not going to happen he'll be dropped himself and it is Vitality with a lovely maneuver there out of the apartments and it's going to be the midt hunter the challenge first 5 seven in hand can they flash him in is there anything they can do oh it doesn't I mean Mony does have a flash right now but they're just going to hold on to the setup but with the arch taken at this point it's up to the shot shot from these players that are trapped in the bomb site already but it doesn't matter one head shot for him there you can see that is slowing down these oncoming Vitality players snacks coming up from above with the balcony gets Jax as well but no they're getting overwhelmed ni a chance right there but only the single kill although Spinx he's on 3 HP Ms has his own deagle his own flashbang he can set himself up in this one he is known as a demon with the deagle he definitely has the opportunity to make this one work the first shot rattles up and gives his position away he won't be able to find it the Force by is not successful here let's see what they've got for us the CT side has to come online right here right now some kind of plan that's what they need smoke down at the bottom of banana nade right there at the foot of Apex great start right there for G2 this is already looking promising Nico and Ms to contest at the top Corner good utility again man this is really shaping up well for them and Jack he's right in front of that smoke and Ms he wants a piece of him flashes right there Ms though yeah with all that inflicted Dam e and that is going to be another this is exactly what GED little bit dicey but they have found the opening couple of frags here five versus three Apex low as well and G2 right now they're playing to give they don't want to put anybody actually in the bomb site they don't want to lose two players too easily Nico's going to play the spot right here oh that's that is a good on these two players this might actually have to be the retake unless Ms is able to inflict damage from above yes he has a little bit of a window oh okay he's taking his time with the Trier discipline n wait what what he justed his own teammate right there Apex an opportunity a 1v3 I don't know what just happened but don't lose this round now don't lose this no no no not like this it can't happen like this the knife round on your own teammate I've never seen anything like it in a Do or Die situation a must-win round the blunder of a lifetime potentially if they give this round up call it a GG it's Apex with a fighting chance here 30 points of Health holding towards emo seeing snacks on the retake first kill doesn't connect thankfully a s of relief comes in from G2 we got to see that replay what in God's name just occurred that's that's just unbelievable it felt like it was going to somehow fall apart from what was seemingly an unusable round for G2 unreal let's have a look at him so it is looking so comfy but of course in G2 fashion it all starts to unravel here you think that's the round it's already done and then how does that even occur he just he's just going through the it looks like he clicked while he and he wanted to Quick switch while going through the smoke it just feels needless Jax threatens the break right there through the smoke but there is no actual contest Mony in the pit right beside him is snack and that is not a peak you usually want to give Mony but he misses the shot now another opportunity around the truck trying to take advantage of that great collateral shot as well finishes it off onto Spinx right there through the top of the truck this is looking good this is exactly what G2 needs needed a shot in the arm you're absolutely right what a see some Mony the collateral kill converted by the head shot Overkill and now Ms MD a bit of a problem here he does need backup Nico come and join him my friends as they've had a couple of confusing situations looked a little bit disjointed at times nice early smoke this time you don't have to hold on to it at the last possible moment with 40 seconds on the clock that's a very powerful smoke but potentially a powerful boost coming in as well that's a nice idea and zyu will convert The Kill we're in trouble now G2 will find Apex elsewhere do they commited towards a b bomb side four on two but zwu is Alive and Well Hunter coming to back up the B bomb side no support utility for Nico he's got to hit the shots right now oh and Z will takes some down great Flash from ja this is actually unraveling for G2 13 seconds left you've got to get this bomb planted Hunter he can pressure the smoke right here but he's not able to find anything Z doesn't even see a single Target but Monas is quick on the flank zwu he's already got four in the round he's looking for the ace to clutch this one out here we go then Mony awp has no information and taken down by one of the world's best zwu will find the ace a five on3 deficit the boost on top of the sandbag opening things up Nico goes down with nothing and the round collapses we thought Mony had done enough here two opening frags nowhere to go with the be bomb site and once again they completely crumbled on that side of the map there a brilliant boost a stroke of Genius but Nico needed one that that is wonderful stuff right there he doesn't see snacks he doesn't see Hunter no way and then he blindsides Mony it has been a terrible last 13 Rounds but snack presented an opportunity it might just continue the nightmare is unceasing for G2 on Inferno unless Mony can turn this one into a dream but no Jax shuts them out immediately that's got to the game Oh my days how have they given this one up in this fashion as well bear in mind Mirage next we've seen what Vitality can do on that map already completely bodied mouth yesterday on it it's a kind of map where they can Thrive where ja can put on another clinic here what a performance he's had now he's 17 and eight on a map we've not seen him play as the standing that's unbelievable he is top fragging right now for Vitality with zwu next to him that's unreal they go for the retake of course but it's just a formality if you ask me there should be no grounds to win this one whatsoever the bomb ticking at some Pace give Jack the final few kills ladies and gentlemen from 61 down Vitality with 30-7 and send us to Mirage it's a tside sta of Vitality and I'm seeing five players make their way over towards the a side of the map this will be an execution smokes towards the steps and jungle likely but mabs MD he had a woeful map of in the previous he needs to step up here with the Jeweler playing close to the ramp already first Contact will come from Ms but Spinx quick on the trigger takes him down the smokes land but Nico able to snipe zyu before they actually deploy so looks like this is going to be a four on four retake situation for the G2 side there is no kit to work with they do have a smoke on snacks that might be the Saving Grace here we go then the retake is certainly possible snacks need to step up here with the USP no d inflicted just yet Vitality burying themselves away towards that ramp itself they have no further utility the smoke has been deployed the head shot delivered Hunter starting to show some form now it's a 10sec defuse and it looks like it's going swimmingly here the Julies connect with nothing and it's a comfortable defuse to close things out G2 back to their winning ways they have taken the Lion Share of these pistols throughout the series Maui so it looked like com going for that sort of furier approach and maybe just a couple of upgraded players but we're not messing around here here whatsoever breaching the initial smoke and it's going to the CTS on the back foot here there's an open bomb side they will pop open the smoke for Jungle with a flashbang is devastating m still comes out on top SP is back but he's getting it done now s to warm up showing as he still keep up with Vitality yeah even in the ankle position Ms is making it look good flash there right at his own feet support there for monesy this is looking so good from G2 they didn't stand on the bomb side although Z is trying to take a little bit of space back but he's only able to find the one kill Apex at that point no chance well put together round by G2 still ready to fight pushing off the angle looking for an opening here nice little grenade towards middle ooh yeah good damage inflicted but still map control being taken from Vitality smoke top con smoke and window looks like Flames is going to be able to take this space away but there's no intent that's been expressed yet for Vitality they have no one on the other sides of the map no extremity players right now all five of their members are right here in the valley in connector Nico though wants to take a bite out of him but ja is there Easy Shot for him on the trade mobs he's playing all the way back in CT spawn there's no space right now for G2 I don't think they can get back into this one they've got everyone in towards ct1 it looks like they might consider this you got an MP9 an awp no one thre the murder hole just yet and yeah starting to peel off this round fell apart quite quickly for them lots of damage from Vitality to kick things off and then finding Nico through the smoke and then he had the bomb was just wide open Spinx he knows that they're going to be saving at this point he might go on a bit of a hunt but they don't really have the resources to justify him out they going to have to hold on to their rifles here no vision whatsoever push back in the jungle g2's got to feel like they got to take some space somewhere you can't just let yourself get pushed all the way back in the bomb site or it's just going to be a repeat of the previous round and Mony he's already switching things up playing right there around triple but the Ferocious attack from Vitality is already there oh no Mony I don't even know if he clicked his Mouse there dude he's had a couple of big misses here on Mirage so far can Nico make up for it he's only good for one it looks like we're done here four versus two is snack and Hunter will have no diffus K belly any utility and an SMG to try and retake the bomb site snack is giv it a go he see there anything available to him even a re aggress towards middle that's what Vitality themselves have been doing lately that's kind of they've mix things up taking the a ramp and taking those je making sure you can't be pincered we saw that on Dust two as well need to be more assertive and reactive to these plays Flames will go down and snack at least saves the awp going to get that to Mony but is it going to be enough he's still good doing good that's where the money is coming from he just never goes down relatively doing well okay Mony though he knows he has to take this round okay he has to fight for something mid Nico's going for a spray from connector Mony right there around the edge of the smoke to take down Flames they needed something like that a little bit of an injection beautiful stuff that's more likely for Mony damage to Apex as well that six sense going on so Apex now misses out on this one but h looks very promising 28 damage and Mony now you can see starting to get in the zone here the grenades are landing nicely as Apex be taken out to 12 points of health so plenty of time on the round though this is not a done deal zyu on the awp yet to stake his claim here on Mirage show us what he's made of it's going to be Mals though stepping up finally an advantage a significant one five on three but zyu still alive and well with Jax and Zord and spin sorry ja has to be an xfactor in this round but Moni takes him out quite quickly Z presented two Targets able to connect with neither okay wait a second they are pressuring him now and Hunter swinging off of catwalk right there makes things easy Spinx 1v4 at this point the team's got pretty good money could try to inflict a little bit of economic damage here because round Victory is out of the question Mony not checking it out right now but it is going to be flashes spin the lead the way can they crack things open here Mony now very aware of it and hits a stunning hch over the awp we'll see what is enough to hold on now Ms will join him as well dying in the flames and still out of nowhere three kills found ni closes it down with the AK-47 that's more like it on the a defense that's a beautiful hold between the a players there M's in a very defensive position in terms of his U he's got nothing left M they've got connected control as well losing control of the situation Mony towards sh might be able to find a couple of valuable picks and gets Molotov down to 19 points of Health Ms called are in the a bomb side they keep theam alive down by in the SM that should be it but bear in mind they got plenty of money here might as well go for it the final round coming up next as snack finds his second kill still yet to die goes three and zero right now two versus two snacks and Mony on the retake but they're so incredibly low oh yeah they are and they're thinking about this right now is snack going for the perfect half he might he really might I mean he's still making his way up right now might give his life up I mean Mon's got one foot out the door already doesn't look like he really wants to commit to this one and I think at this point you are going to offer the safe still a lot of money on his side but just oh my goodness yeah a little more time and there would have been something there but all in all it is Vitality who are going to take their forth in this one great a crunch from them as they find that mid control you see all these blue X's just push back all the way back in Jungle all the way back in CT again one of the more passive rounds from G2 on their defense oh but he peels away There's an opportunity it is right now for Vitality to pounce Flames slowly encroaching towards middle that will be the pincer move coming about Apex is there any way he can set up his teammates he only has a single Flash and actually he's just going to send his body right at the problem Nico's playing in the backline he's at jungle spraying from a distance but smig comes out on top it's a flurry of frags and favor of Vitality two players remaining for G2 but this is a dire retake and it's not even going to get started Jack with the spray down snacks 39 HP nothing he can really do with this one I'm afraid and it's a recovered half of sorts third and final map Here We Go 75 at the end of the first half snack's got what seems to be a CT smoke right there so smoke CT flash over hope for the best here going to have an open season right here so many opportunities No in fact they change it to Jungle or top connector that is in Mony taking a lot of space no contest yet this is going to be a full on fiveon five retake that's if even go towards day it looks like they try to get through towards CD SP and the bomb is planted and now the CTS are in a lot of trouble bear in mind they're smoked off towards connector for now trying to get it towards the window it's getting very awkward indeed though zyu purged up on the ledge hoping for a mistake from Mony here niiko inflicting heavy damage but zwu keeps around alive they know where he is nothing he can do it's a massive Victory as G2 swarm the sight let's see what you got two and N right now would love an open and is certainly a chance to get one hits the tag on snacks down to 30 points of Health Mony hits Ms at the same time as well so the Scout's doing some serious work out there setting up these MP9 to Glory oh and the push the play to punish Nico waiting right there for Spinx oh this is looking good for G2 they have so much control so much space it would have to be a disaster for this to fall apart for them but they are making their way up oh no Z this is a chance for him okay opportunities presenting themselves but no shots being hidden very uncharacteristic of him but he's able to finally strike takes down mobs Flames lying and waiting the sandwich oh no this is falling apart unless Nico's able to recover it it looks like they are recovering and that is it Jax yeah he's here right now with the MP9 but it's down to a 1 V one here we go snack planting the bomb and does not have the advantage here Jax knows exactly where he is it's the SMGs going Toe to Toe a couple of bullets land will win the round here for SN Jax and bring them back into the second half he's got no utility snack's waiting for his moment needs to stop him getting closer and closer towards the side good damage inflicted here it's going to be a close finish and S he'll come out on top ducking and weaving around the bom say it's a massive Victory there yeah he was hoping for the mistake but snack never presented one Maui with forced bying again they came down oneus one they are fully sending it and it's collapsed it's unraveled at the seams flames and Spins removed early on the economy will be in disarray if they lose this round cleanly Apex jacks up the MP9 Z on the Scout once again no real damage though as Hunter he's going to take a bit of a risk here he's going to see there's an open B bomb sign that's absolutely fine they've got such a huge Advantage he's got that MP7 at range and still alive and well take the Scout shot to the limb but overall looks at the round is done zyu is low and Apex with the MP9 there's nothing he can do hey yeah turn around right there snack you spotted him he's in the zone right now yeah he's doing so well I mean snacks on six and four right now Henry they he might break the this might be it and what better time to do it than now as2 go up 10 to and vitality I have to say they're playing like they're The Underdogs another force fight in a row right here one more round for series Point Grand Final Point these are reactions we didn't see from G2 in that first off right like once you have a lack of information you can feel the pressure coming through get that aamp control try and lock them out but they should be aware of this yes yes they have to be aware of it Mony and Nico they got to trade this one out Flames he's covering so many angles and oh he's unable to find the shot Apex is now close to the ramp it's got 19 kills this has been a sensational game for him huge bounce back you never really see Nico fall off in a series that hard and Apex okay this is a really hard angle flash right there there is a there is some counter utility but the pinch is coming in from connector right there incision onto that aside beautiful work here G2 looked like they're locked in for series and Grand Final points snack sure he goes down but it's Intel at the very least and no Spinx in towards that kitchen position and now surely nothing can be done we have got Jax waiting in TT borwn right now Nico and Mony both at the top of the board and now only one player survives it's going to be zwu given the AK-47 the buy is not too bad overall but certainly concessions Apex and spin with no grenades P send towards top of middle once again the iname leader with two kills to his name sits behind the smoke massive grenade once again and Ms can he find it doesn't matter Z will Tak him through the smoke still a four and four though Spinx is found elsewhere and now Apex there it is that's a nice play can he get the double son to come to life here they've got the man Advantage three versus two Nico though right there in the palace there is a smoke ahead of him and now J okay great push from him this should actually throw the round in favor of Vitality even more so and monest yeah okay he's going to rely on Nico here he's got to find something okay wait a second Mony gets the kill on a Jax but un fortunately Nico can't find anything on that a bomb site although that is a safe passage towards B Mony has a real shot to close it here he doesn't opt for the B bomb set itself he's going to slow it right down he has got a lot of time to work with and a full utility belt he's got the smoke the flashes and the molotov here both players on the CT side bunker it up in towards the a side itself and it looks like they've read it well he'll be making his way through his connector but it's by no means guaranteed that they win this round a no scope in this sort of situation would be such a Mony play but he's going to overlook him and Z will take him down 12 to6 they cut this one down to size Apex once again challenging towards top and middle will have spin with him there's a come crashing down right here right now snack actually found some pretty decent timing have no idea he's in position that's a freeb for snx there it is Apex on the other side as well smoking towards the window Molotov over he won't anticipate this snack is going down and the man Advantage once again securely in favor of Vitality and Z knows he tagged up right there okay oh still from the grave is able to get one and Nico yeah trying to find something from the palace once again that is not going to work out for him Molly sends him packing holding that jungle position and Nico oh gets a bit of an inking that he could be there on the other side flashbang they set up Hunter and actually takes cro off the angle nice moloto they might be able to do something with this one they're getting space they're taking it quickly okay flashes there but Flames yeah still from the backline and Jack on the clean up as well 12 to7 Vitality they're building the case just point G2 they're just going through the motion taking this space cleanly Little Resistance has been offered just yet from vitality and this is a this is a winning position but that's a great n yeah that's legit Max damage right there right in the face into the pocket down to 40 points of Health here and B split looking possible but SP is very well positioned to deal with snacks I like that finds Flames that's a very important kill takes his total to 9 and n as he looks towards the window as well he can find the second has snacked that enough to single-handedly book them a place in the Grand Final here he might do it he might do it okay Hunter opportunity I think he might have spotted the elbow of zyu right there looks like they just passed each other no I think Hunter does know in fact that Z's there making a lot of noise though oh no oh he's taking all the space away this is going to be a near impossible retake on the side of Vitality but Spinx actually no he slipped into short okay on Z but Spinx holds on is this it the three on two Advantage Spinx needs to find multiple kills he gets nothing it's been a quiet performance for atex he can't hold on and G2 have done it it was looking precarious it was looking dangerous but it's snack that finds the double kill and gets them to the Grand Final
