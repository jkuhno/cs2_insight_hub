welcome to the Singapore Garden of Counter Strike we've got Vitality taking on mouth they battle it out for their share of $1 million a completely packed arena is ready for the pandemonium of dust two and it looks like we've got a nice B execution coming in Mari nice and quick here five players but the CT defense looks locked and loaded yat in the back of the site already broling up close with the dues he's been devastating with those great counter smoke but it doesn't even matter zyu quick with the head shot yat still shooting from the back lines not able to find anything just yet it's AB Su from the winner four kills for the leader an ace to kick things off for the leader of ma a fantastic defense rattles Vitality the perfect smoke is set up as they come through the tunnel entrance and shuy decimates every single player nothing but head shots here look at him go it couldn't be cleaner they executed to the bide Shore the doesn't quite land the window is wide open and shuy punishes with an opening Ace ma already showing that the big arena doesn't scare them they're they've been gaining momentum off of the back of a grand final finish at Rio and shui he's leading by example Apex trying to do the same but it doesn't matter brol in so quick with the MP9 right there this is looking pretty good already for ma yeah they've been trying to find these advantages through middle this has been a very common response if Vitality lose a man they try to find something through those double doors it's what they did versus liquid and they're trying it once again but they seem ready for good counter utility and broland doubles up broland has been having a fantastic tournament wherever his some of his colleagues hav stepped up he has been a constant force of nature finds himself another hattick here and now that should be the round this Force by has done literally nothing for Vitality no damage inflicted no bomb plan that's for sure as we see a five versus is one and two here for Spinx he's got the Scout the deagle The Flash but bomb down and it should just be a matter of time uh this is looking way too good for Mouse here Vitality bear in mind with the standing and getting their clocks rocked here as it will be Torchy to close things out has to be the full Eco Maui that for spy has done nothing for him when they're Crossing through those double doors if Ms jump laad asically if they don't throw a smoke a nade z he's good for the shot oh the H that's an old school approach there I love to see it and a long take coming through long corner smoke enable Spinx to go for the challenge towards the car itself Jackson Spinx working in tandem cracking things open Vitality have arrived this round's locked in there'll be no way you can consider the retake here Jim fan and broland already is towards t-spawn that's more like it this is a lovely pck for Vitality I think with the stand in dust too you're playing on spawns you're playing off Instinct and players like Jax are going to thrive in this environment Smoke on the cross smoke towards their boxes as well and speaking of the boxes shuy there lovely defensive smoker 40 seconds that is stifling can pop it open and go for an all pick here but shu's repositioning and might be funneling them through Middle with that short smoke I I think this could be a oh Shou push the smoke what is that all right well there's two players that are actually trying to go mid to B right now Brolin finds Spinx and now Vitality they're still behind that smoke there's 20 seconds left right now but there is nobody guarding the bomb site except for torsi holding the cross this is the first shot unfortunately oh can't hit the second either Jax takes down it's got to be exertion at this point one head shot to kick things off it's tough to approach this position we got to jump up on the boxes but all three players from now stuck trapped in CT spawn what an absolute fumble there from toi that's what he's designed to do there was no flashbang no pressure they were scrambling in towards the aight he's cost them the round he's had a difficult tournament some Kevlar there as we push towards middle you're going to see a lot of this on the CT side on Dust too it's very meta right now but uh we'll see whether this first kill goes in their favor we've got something going on here oh the catch Shacks off there on the long L zwu though usually not the one to be caught off himself able to find one no Yad actually is able to take him down three on three Yad oh he actually recovers the off he's able to find it one but Apex quick with the trade man oh man that's getting very scary out there bear in mind zorian has Kevlar and the MP9 and nice position here SP comes through can't nail the initial shot but he converts it on the spray man Advantage here here two versus one for mous on the full Eco they brought just an MP9 and USPS into this particular round and vitality potentially give it away it's Apex 50 seconds remaining ma he's got the bomb in his back and a boatload of utility this could be the play as he flanks in towards B zers is exposed oh yeah if he finds this first long range with the MP9 makes it look easy and now put Vitality in a very precarious spot smoke for the cross and another default and I'm sure they'll be ready to patrol middle Apex has had enough and full sending it up towards short that's a risky maneuver oh yeah that's fast Apex saying nobody is actually watching this he's done his homework on this yeah right already has the cat control here but Tori right on the line there we go okay he needed that one for himself for us the audience everybody the Counterstrike Community love to see that one convert in it's going to have to be a mid to be split the looks of things here flames and zwu have decent control in terms of the util they have SM for spawn spins waiting towards uper but it looks quite Telegraph no pressure elsewhere Jimmy and bran in towards that b side together yeah but there's a double up Brolin's got it right in the B bomb site right now that is going to surprise Vitality if they do decide to end there ja still making his presence known at short but it seems to be a ruse Rolan holding the line he spots an elbow oh that is quick had all the advantages he could ask for there and the round sudden to fall apart once again Jimmy consider to be one of the best anchors in World Counter Strike right now a huge spray down barely touches Spinx and he gets himself double entries into towards the be sides as zwu answers back another clean round and it looks like Mouse will have to hold on to the AK-47 another collapse there look like broland like he said the secondary or against the rifle a scrappy buy though we see yat on the Famas Brolin on the MP9 those are the two B Defenders though so that side of the map is going to be quite weak I don't think we can run a standard CT set up here I think they'll be looking to push in towards B they're going to boost at the back this is quite nice and it's worked out great maneuver zyu didn't see it coming whatsoever and they've got the early Advantage T warming up into this series now can they convert though Jax taking some control towards long we've got zers tucked away in the pit I don't think they really check this they certainly do I take it back beautiful shot there from Jax to equalize the round to four and four that's a great shot great clear from Jax as well got to react though broland considering it we said they have to push yeah exactly Ma they're getting active they know that they're on the back foot right now but they're not going to stay that way Roland pushing up right now through the tunnels might be able to catch a timing here there's an opportunity for him and you can see that he's going to be joining up from the short player as well they're going for a pinch right now towards this middle sight Spinx it's such a strong off angle though I think he might have spotted a shadow yes he did in fact One Kill from him already but there are bodies that are coming out doesn't matter both these angles are covered vitality knew exactly what was coming next godamn Spinx is in the zone right now reads them like a book waiting for those reactions to present thems as you see the buy come through it's not the same story for M I'm afraid uh they go for a partial investment around the saved m4s so it's going to be the 57 and the deagle for bran and Co okay we got shui making a play early on realizes that he's got a change trip but oh immediately taken down by Spinx Vitality they're just too thorough in these defaults catching every single aggressive play now now feel like they're just getting stuffed at every single Corner no no no definitely not yeah this is Vitality potentially overcooking the situation they got these two kills towards B but they all the Boost oh okay this could find something all right to is able to get one but a quick trade that's necessary the thing is you now know the two players are there they boosted behind that smoke you've got that information it's a four versus two so you can pretty much guarantee there's only going to be one player that a bomb side but here comes Zan as well still towards the double doors will he take the peak he's going to have to and the shots land to some extent but he takes heavy damage himself Jimmy we need to see something quite special here good for one they know exactly where the final player is Apex he can't find him but sping certainly can and vitality Mari are officially on fire CTS are hunting for information it's toy off towards Shore with the awp but doesn't spot anyone just yet he's got to come up with something there too shallow I think oh no it's quite nice actually that is not bad he's been so good at finding the opener with the awp this time a lot of damage with the off but now the pressure is on the B players once again broling and Y they've been stuffed this entire half but this time they stand up rolling with two and now the bomb is in no man's L right there on the B ramp Apex fully blind okay finally Ma they're back into this one five rounds at the half unless zwu has something to say about it it was looking quite woeful here for Mouse on the gun rounds but finally they wake up and it's going to be five on the board a disappointing performance but Signs of Life towards the end here as we go 75 in favor of Vitality by no means is this one over ma showing life at the end of the half okay I think we got a B Rush once again Jax though head shot to kick things off flash right there in his face so many targets to present themselves but Spinx is also firing in from the window and they are immediately stopped at the entrance of the tunnel anything Mouse can do Vitality can do better it's the exact same approach a b Rush on the pistol and five head shot delivered once again not an ace this time but still just as clean there it will be Vitality going 8 to five and more importantly no plant here on the B bomb side this has no worked out for them whatsoever but it's certainly has of Spinx that is something quite special there ice cold with the USP so many CTS now op for a heavy rifle mid setup doesn't look like Vitality are going to be going for that this time it is in fact a long hold there's a late long pop no one actually contest this I love a long take that's delayed I wait for the initial U don't have to run through the grenades Corner smoke and it just takes so much away from the CT they have to react to this you can't really allow five players out of the long area see if they can answer back and it's going to be Z range that would do nicely Dy in all the chaos did find Apex at the same time but Z with the bomb towards long Jimmy patrolling towards lower B and they're going to try and find some Intel here they don't know how many players are towards long so pushing towards short making sure they can't be pined on the a side the utility though look at this Ma just a single Molotov left it's going to be nearly impossible to cross and they're actually vacating the premises they're leaving torsi in the pit but it looks like the real fight's going to be towards mid it's all about timing here shui with the spray but zyu quick on the trade yat he's not able to find anything from lower oh important tool but both players back on up Jax is pushing in towards UPA B and they are none the wiser Jimmy is preoccupied with the short play zyu to sh in a barrel keeping him interested it's Jax goes any further he's got a free kill he decides to hold up for now spins he'll find Tori and this looks like a perfectly maneuvered flank as Jax has timed it well he'll spot him and get the freeb the money was low but Vitality a perfect reaction Mai after losing long they push in towards sha reclaim middle get upper B and make sure there's no execution potential whatsoever it's a very convincing round as two players survive and it's double digits here for Vitality they get three rounds in a row with no bomb PL so far and now 11 to 5 one round away from m point this has been a little bit too convincing for my liking Mouse need to wake up right here right now on their T side roling testing the waters at long a okay take that's an opener kill on to Apex he's going to be happy with that doesn't press the issue no of course Apex yeah he's having a struggles some game but at this point his team has been so polished that I don't think he needs to worry all too much despite this man Advantage but we'll see this could be a round that breathes some life into the mouse will shuy and Co over cook it looks like they're absolutely fine the bombs towards long this one's done and it will be a clean round finally here for Mouse flames and Z will hold towards middle shuy watching the extremities make sure that no one can that towards short so everything is looking ra ni well converted off of the opening pick from Brolin playing to punish in the middle understanding that Vitality are one of the most active teams in the mid round as soon as they lose a pick anywhere on the map well you don't want to lose everything here though Vitality hold on Flame this is a precarious position one that you do not want to find yourself in when you're just trying to keep this gun Alive N right there at his feet able to find the kill on a Gad but I do not think that he is long for this world exertions right on the other side and CT spawn Sho is going to be approaching from both sides he will be crunched in a matter of seconds and really it's just a it's it this is a foregone conclusion for me wait okay hold on hold on hold on exertion at this point surely okay nice work that's more like it there for Mouse slowing things down finding those PS converting their advantages and finding all five players there at the end down but not out the individuals slowly coming to life in not the clean it spray from broland but like we said Apex showing signs of frustration he's going to be in his own head right now he goes down they're not working together on that long take it's a little bit messy from the CT side but still that's their one blemish so far in the second half it's currently 4-1 in favor of Vitality on their CT campaign shot through the do ja gets a taste of the awp down to 19 points good tag right there Z had enough m going to hit that all day long he knew he was and now Zan removed a five on four still hunting for map points here and I dare say they might have it five versus three Jimmy shuy and torg need to work together now heavy lifting I hate to say it needs to be done by the sniper he needs to find these picks he'll be challenging one of the world's best right now zyu Prim position takes him down and guarantees map point of this stage another head shot delivered as Jimmy there's nothing he can do ding to the back of B ja stepping up to the plate once again and delivering the goods they've got six map points in the bag courtesy of zwu it's not the best for ma they've got some Firepower there some rifles to work with but the utility is a bit lacking and you can see that Vitality are feeling emboldened the captain of the team himself going for a midwing not favoring his chances at this point there's no support no backup but some long control plane FL deep yeah they're taking down bra they've had enough of him yeah he's been the only one finding those picks towards long time and time again he's had relative success this could be GG ladies and gentlemen Vitality with the stand in their map pick have just outclassed them in pretty much every facet of the game I guess the pistol opening for Mouse in the first half they got that nice 30-0 start but we've seen literally nothing since Apex what what is this the gamble stack towards be at A Moment Like This he's in his head if this works out he is going to feel so good about this read Jax playing the close Corner Spinx got the n in hand he's going for the jump spot Jax as long as he's able to get a there's one and Spinx with the quick trade oh that that should be all she wrote I'm afraid two players in the bomb down in the worst as possible position they've done well with the flashbangs here one more Kill from spin will do it brings out the USP wants to close things out in style and zers to keep the dream alive on Dust two a map they will want to forget Maui they have not turned up to the first map of his quarter the individuals have looked weak as Vitality smother them on their map pick the individuals were weak the in-game leaders a top frager that's great for him but we need to see massive game here from this young man Jimmy as they set up for an a execution here expect smokes towards the steps towards the jungle and flam are first Contact he can't find the initial head shot struggling here but somehow s Alive Burning to a Cris living up to his name thriving in the chaos gets himself a couple tion fighting back here and it looks like mous they can't find any footing whatsoever the initial kills were there low HP on apex and Ja as the round comes to a hold they're going to try and reset and make their way towards connector no CT smoke makes this ever harder more difficult but exertion he's going to fight his way out of it takes down that connector presence some damage towards Apex but with 2 Hp he's able to fire back and take down yat now exertion 47 HP he needs this one for ma they need a good start here on Mirage it's looking like he can pull this one off though working together going to put Apex on the end of the fishing rod here as bait as they try and work out exactly where Zan is and where's the trade where's the swing coming through from Spinx here he holds his nerve he knows he has the advantage here bom plant at the very least guaranteed there's a grenade though Maui that could be enough touchdown as we do see him convert the round and fortunately with Spinx the bomb is planted H not so much a default I think they're getting ready for an a play we've got two play contact in towards the a side itself and it's going to be a smoke deployed By Flames tucks himself in dominates uran towards the ramp and he's ready for the second as well this is beautiful from Flames as he lights them up with the M4 five on Two And the round is done shuy and Tori limp in with a scout and a tech 9 oh yeah this was just supposed to be a lurk play an X Factor in the round it was supposed to go better out of that ramp but no flames stops them all looking for the ace one more kill that's all he needs toy though he will be contested by Apex hits the head shot on him that still keeps the ace alive that's what the crowd wants right now that's what they're waiting for and Flames he's right there by the ramp standing practically on the bomb at this point but he is low HP they definitely want to keep him alive into this one playing on top of the balcony Tori he will be coming from Palace there is a chance here for Flames to complete the Highlight that's what we're looking for toy he's got the Famas no no hope in this round so little time left and it looks like spot will be there smoke right at his feet at this point you might just call it off completely he's going to clean him up burning the whiskers off of mous is Flames dude that was such a sick sequence I can't wait to see the replay of that what a position he finds towards the bomb set itself leaps up finds a Pixel Perfect headshot to open things up and then a lovely spray down to get the three kills and of course the acees well you love to see that from flames and this is the real problem he is looking razor sharp right now look how confident he is there's no real push back there's no flashbangs the contact play sure there's something there but I'd like to see a little bit more execution potential when you're going to be making your way in with such a heavy investment they've got to challenge him that that's my call they got to challenge him at some point in this one see if he is uncomfortable in this B anchor position but that's not how MA are going to start this one shui early map control window smoke top midm smoke as well seated at the bottom of connector they already have some good space but this is how act Rio played out for them they were able able to find this mid control but it was the bomb site conversions that were there undoing those players in the sides were able to assemble crossfires but Flames wants to go a step further goes in front of the smoke in front of the Molly there's a tick right there and he nailed toward he across the map zurin quick with the trade zyu tries to stand up and now Mouse that's a little bit of momentum yeah you love to see that good trade that's more like it from Mouse the bomb is down but they got plenty of time and it looks like a is wide open this round is going to be there's no problem Spinx and Jax holding in towards B and it's the first gun round Landing in their favor but bear in mind with a 30-0 start this round will always be a little bit compromised to the CTS you're going to have some residual fasses SMGs in the mix and now the first real gun round comes up next that's when the zy awp can be deployed very similar look to what we got in the previous round exertion coming from underpass right now again flames and zyu they are contesting this connector they don't want to give it up for free but this time around zyu he's got the awp re smoking towards window smoking towards top con Vitality they have no TOS to go for it Apex out of the window right there but T's there to clean things up he's had a difficult game thus far a difficult tournament thus far and it's actually going to continue how badly did Apex won that AK-47 it cost him his life but still they have the man Advantage very very important round for their economy the bomb hasn't been spotted Spinx has got it top of middle one minute remaining plenty of time for br and Jimmy but so much to do and Z were encroaching on their position I was about to say a freeb that's one of the rare misses you'll see from zou that one was on a silver platter does it cost him the round that is the question spin still with bomb control ticket boo Peak and he Nails the second and the third give him three shots yeah he's going to hit two of them okay and a very good start here for Vitality on the CT campaign looking for the two Duro looking to eliminate M who said the Arenas don't phase him anymore I'm not so sure okay they finally want to do it they need to test the stand and this needed to happen at one point or another and Ja right there with Spinx there's a smoke right there at Spinx that's going to take him off the angle good Molotov that's going to slow the push down and now Mount they're rethinking things they're thinking are we going to double pump this because Brolin he's made his way out Tetris at this point zyu he might get blindsided at this point this is a good angle for Brolin oh he has a real opportunity here to find a kill in Jungle Apex doesn't matter what a shot from Apex and Jax said he's going to be tested eventually can he rise to the occasion one kill would do it shu is looking for a double and Jax will find him maintaining that Advantage down a 19 points of Health exertion playing on the front lines here didn't anticipate a second player back and forth we go Jackson zyu now thrust into the clutch a nice grenade won't deny the plan but definitely chips away a Jim fat one player towards the bench Jimmy he'll join him as they wave for the rotation to come through jack is walking wounded he actually rotates all the way back through towards the kitchen he'll join zwu offensive smoke allows him to get out the window Z will throw away the awp time ticking away now who will make the first move here another nice grenade there's significant damage once again Jimmy one bullet away huge round here for Mouse looking for their second up against Z though and Jimmy will find him finally they break through it's just an MP9 oh you're right oh Flames this is going to be so difficult Apex yeah he's at the jungle right now but he's being moled out right now okay that Molly doesn't actually burn him they might overlook this position FL hiding in the smoke that is a great support no to his this has thrown everything out of order and look at this Vitality despite the fact that the lone Defender had MP9 the Cavalry arrived they threw all of the utility he needed and Flames is able to stand the test and that's a massive round bear in mind they had two MP9 there as well and now we've got two awp Spinx will be bringing it out towards a b bombsite and he's going to have some action here we might have a b Rush Spinx is ready can he open things up you better believe he can great start and it's already dissuading ma they're tuck and tail running on back recognizing that there is a new danger of foot a double op setup timing eludes them Tori just about getting towards the palace Flames though he senses something to foot this is the bomb Maui if he gets his kill cleanly the round is in tatters as now it's a five versus three and he's not going to just hold on to it it's fine they can go recovered the bomb we don't have the resources or the manpower to justify staying there so he's just going to peel off and zwu another Miss there maybe a significant one this round was looking super comfy for a second but Spinx he gets his second all frag of the round just such an imposing presence from Spinx on his awp mid- round kill right there and really torsi and shui this is a Monumental task shui's got to find something immediately labored spray around the triple box so much damage inflicted but no kill with 25 seconds remaining this has to be a win from T but no flames holds on six rounds on the board for vitality and the money for ma oh it's it's not good the full Eco now as Mouse present nothing we've got Glocks that is pretty much it zers with the P250 and Apex looking to pad some stats right now getting towards top of middle damage inflicted and head shot return and that's ja a little bit of a struggle there towards B but thankfully Spinx is there to pick up the pieces and deny the rifle being recovered speaking of which though towards B it's going to be a finish on that side of the map you can see him just trying to get the utility and maybe deny the rifle throw it out the map potentially and we'll see if he can hold on oh there's no help though okay oh oh he gets for this well done good job oh what a transfer what a spray from Spinx right there no worries no worries at all the ace for Spinx it's not there Henry it has not looked good the individuals for ma they are having some difficulties here in Singapore like Jimmy like considered one of the best Mirage players in the game I was would say he's currently 2 and seven zers in a star rifle he has turned out to be fair but brolan one and eight flashbang towards middle and it's a bit of a fumble this time from Spinx he had a freebie there he thought he got the kill disengaged and actually is taken down but Z towards sha a scary Prospect in Jax I like this Mari oh yeah this is impressive here Jax deep in the apartment but great counter strafe there from exertion that was Swift stuff zwu though he's already holding the angle and an off angle at that exertion contest the player at window drops a smoke out he's just going to cover his own Retreat broland you got to win this one if you want to give your team a chance he does now the a bomb side it's free for the taking and at this point it's just zwu left there and Ma they look to be converting what was in some ways a very chaotic round fights across the board in middle in apartments on the a bomb site and they th Thrive through it waiting for a mistake here looking if he can find anything but time is sticking away is he just looking for the exits to this stage ah yeah at this point what 15 seconds left is it the ninja no no surely not it could be he said he's got money they were be expecting him to save the or okay he was think about I think he was thinking about it if he's going to even peek the bomb site that late into in Final Round Maui and the money is decent no double or set up but Z certainly got his smoked off towards a window will reposition nice grenade towards middle speaking of which another one there towards the ram lots of Chip damage and that's very beneficial these now m4s can have head shot D potential and speaking of which we have got Apex down towards lower flashed in and that is lovely from the in-game leader that should be enough to win the round there'll be no saving here it's number 12 as they look for eight rounds on the board I dare say they've got it one player remaining it's Tori hasn't got much done with the awp once again Mia on Dust 2 he's been struggling throughout this tournament if he can somehow piece together a four onone clutch all will be forgiven to even have a chance in this one he's going to have to first pass the test which is Flames with the awp curious to be wielding it and really tzy might be presented opportunity but yeah they know exactly where he is at this point an eighth round for Vitality a stalwart defense and looking to close this out in two maps it could be enough to bring them back to life here Mirage utility spotted calls made he knows they're on Route smokes will take his vision away he'll have to spam through the smoke here and hope for the best drops down I think they're making it look like a fake at first no okay never mind all right all right they're going to press on forward that is a free bomb site this is a full re take here for M it's looking too comfortable that's the bomb plan locked in but they do have diffuse k m this might be D design they've got a smoke themselves they can Flash in Smoke the bomb apply pressure but they do need to find kills first first brag available now spin to be challenged Z ready to swing he's going to have to now and there's so many CTS arriving at the bombai here they're coming out on top can they get this defuse going is looking way too good the retake is Stella as they find all five kills taking one casualty on roots Tech 9 though for Apex Bare Bones utility they only have a couple of flashes remain it's going to come down to the head shot and it has to be said Vitality have delivered in that department time and time again ja not his best work no trade potential little bit of damage inflicted towards broland but he doesn't come out on top and that key jeel Shadow spotted by SP flashbang delivered and bwan starting to step up here towards P go it was a bit of a ruse can they at least get a Boman down again oh Apex and Scrappy that's more like it breach is the B bomb side and the round is back on toy right there at the windows he gets a glimpse of Apex but no shot three on three and Brolin despite the heroes earlier in the round he's on 6 hp he's in the back line right now this is so difficult there is a kid on Tori time is still on their side nade sails in no kill flames on the bomb site itself zyu from The High Line and right there Apex he is holding the line along with his teammates no not like this you cannot collapse like this T he's dancing desperately around the site but it's not enough Apex coming in from the short side with the tech 9 long range sniping the emper player a five on three in the most important round of the series so far even such a scrappy first interaction he had 10 shots before he even connected and somehow delivers the first sink on the second player Apex carries them through as it has to be the force by Anu he's had enough your star rifler shuts down the top frager for m and that's an early five on four Spinx look he's going to replicate that form as well Pixel Perfect head and pretty much a guaranteed round tap tapping away that is too clean from Spinx they are putting them in the dirt tzi is the lone player left he's got the Scout right there but this is a 10th round off of a force buy from ma they are up against what feels like a constantly it's an insurmountable task at this point they have to rely on somebody somebody needs to bring them back into it exertion can't be the only one standing up we've talked about yat so much this year about how much of a star he is and even the toughest roles he has yet to join the server a this is disappointing for M I have to say that he haven't showed up and bear in mind that was the force by we're at 105 they have to full Eco now be proactive be forward because if you're just going to let vitality and Knack their entire plan you are going to fail and I like this Tori he heard this he knows that he needs to be a Difference Maker here right here in the underpass early Sphinx seems like he has a clue though that there's a possibility but Apex are you kidding right there instantly annihilating exertion he was struggling on Dust too he looked frustrated of his own individual form and he's turned his game around shy will answer back but they can't hold on to the four and four this is for elimination point the semi-finals looking locked in now for Vitality they stepped up to the arena and mouse they have not they have shrunk they've unraveled the stars have not sha Bri whatsoever brawand started to have a surgent in the initial stage of this half it looked like he could really do something with this he's up to seven sure but they need to find this round if he can somehow step up with this gal that would be fantastic two players peeking towards middle and it's going to be zwu maintaining the man Advantage shuy his name plated towards the connector now so they know the maximum there one player towards B but what a player it is considered one of the best B bombs side anchors in the world and taken care of by that flashbang shy low HP three versus one and they know he was in connector before yeah no this is for ma still the uphill battle gets ever more difficult Shu I mean the one Saving Grace here is that they are headed right towards him there is a chance for a heroic play from him I'm not counting him out just yet but as soon as ja sees him that's it 12 to5 you don't want to see it go down like this but after this performance yeah I'm not sure the semi-finals were deserved let's have a look is it come crashing down right here right now it feels like it's the time for Vitality to close things out Apex in his good form is taken down by brolan early Advantage here but still we are going to see them commit towards the a side they busted through the a ramp Flames waiting to attack the connect flashed off yeah you're right there's no assist there that is a team Flash oh no okay well things are unraveling here unless zwu brings it back you can't count this guy out under any circumstances nade right there the tzi almost takes him down zyu think he has an idea that there's a player here though right to his left oh it's not clearing the angle out toy that's your time to strike but that's the glass was too worried about it he took his time and Z finally taken down yat early on in the B Apartments to finish things off at the top of connector and broland does save the day and close things out oh man that that round was so messy if you threw it on the streets of Singapore you just get arrested on the spot okay zyu taking down TZ nice entry frag early on five on four advantage got to react and here it comes Apex one step ahead of him he knows his potential for this one can't get the double kill but maintaining a man advantage and Ja working in tandem the French Duo it looks like Vitality are going to the semifinals unless ginat can step up with a massive heroic four versus one a good start sure but still so much work to do he's down to 40 points of Health he is so far away from the battle they know exactly where he is he's got a smoke an H grenade as well to keep Mouse in in the tournament the young fin needs to deliver something ungodly and he couldn't be further away if he tried top and middle has to rotate it needs a Reload now he's only got 11 bullets in the the magazine here I don't see a way he can do it and Ladies and Gentlemen even with this stand in it's no problem for Vitality as they book themselves a place in the semifinals
