let's see if he can change it you know we said yesterday there was a big conversation about team spirit just being more rational right that's what ztics was saying that the time off was going to help this team do and I think that in Don versus Nico that case is another one where rationality will help Don if he's able to employ it just a great it's a great word to to strive for opening kill he's going to try to double down with the flashbangs finding their targets good support from snacks good pistol from G2 I mean that could not have gone any better they absolutely tear him apart and uh that's snacks coming through with the utility assistance that's straight off Peak form G2 right there and adding quickly asight was a problem even versus Vitality yesterday for Spirit you felt like the rounds they won were the ones Vitality decided to go to be oh just go to fuse if only it was that easy if only you could buy time terrorists win you know and it was like a long travel into a nice destination parallels to draw to Singapore oh yeah mobs finds the opening kill versus Chopper M's not jet lagged MLBs G2 if I had told you that six months ago you would have laughed he is now on the short list of stars from the Americas that make it into a European call up short list ztics whoa hold on whoa 5 seven for the double kill into the Berettas we've got a minute for the clock oh they pick up a smoke and they have the bomb and they get an AK on ztics the pistols again huh double kill out of ztics I mean the brettas that's oh he missed that did he see that I think snacks feels like he's locked in yeah whoa oh my God he's going to miss this oh he's going to miss it started running Don just checked it after running as well I thought Oh I thought snacks also ran Let's It Go and so ztics 5 S and the Magic's Beretta there to help him o little stack on the front side of middle and that's going to cost G2 one round early opening kill 5v4 and then this that would happen as snacks and sometimes maybe she ztics in the corner here supported yet again chopper double kill all right not bad lines up a head shot through the smoke a little gift given as team spirit forc their way into the full gun rounds cheeky timing here for Don into position at the right time can he just close it on his own cuz he's got no support ooh nothing for donk snack gets an entry uh oh that's that could be a that could be a round straight up that's a good position here for G2 all right utility comes flying back Ms and Mony tethered nicely Shiro on the opposite side doesn't want to lose his op so he's going to have to walk away and this is Spirit offering up a solo donk hold over towards the B site and guess what it blows up in their faces dude that is just there that is just what G2 are so good at though a main utility to set up MBS that snacks helping him out trying to set him up we get aggression out from bite so they don't go for the dark fight they smoke it and then instead try to take it out long and they get a edge with that Magic's good trade frag it's a key it's a key duel to take and they go one for one but they come with info as well so now pressure goes back towards ztics but this side of the map is pretty well fortified you have Shiro here with the op as support a flash for him too but no smoke to block so again this entry pack oh get away he gets away with one which isn't half bad all things considered he was under the microscope yesterday in the shortcomings of spirit so one frag totic good enough to set up the rotation where all goes well okay keep them in the sight with the first dark smoke and then what put up a wall for the commitment what's the play here G2 one Fizzles BBS hits a de shot there comes the smoke grenades down from Long Don locks in the double and as he turns it back he's getting squeezed but it's a triple kill from Don which is real nice they're going for the op Hunter no he's sprays down through the edge of smoke and poor Hunter's left 1 V3 he's got the Kevlar and the AK and utility to boot but the pressure comes out from Chopper Don does enough to set up the team so that they can sweep away what's left you're going to the wrong site boys did Don not just teach you a lesson with that they got shirro over here though now I know you know they have learning here we go ex comes out uhoh it's pretty quick out of nowhere and Chopper can only get the one this time around of course Don is already dead empty-handed so pressure on Magic's to go above and beyond he gets pressured back through smoke and this rotation is not quite finding its space to get into sight smoke over G2 like you're saying bomb yet to cross that a Molly on default it is they have to wait it out too so the smokes will come up this might get a little bit more Scrappy in a second shot from shirou as they hear that bomb going down Mony not interrupted ztics will kill Ms that's one there's two ztics coming out from Temple takes a man advantage to the favor of spirit it's not like what's left of G2 has much health and shirro has a smoke there it is that's going to take ni out of the equation unless he gets away with the spray or they give him an angle on the top of the smoke ztics walking up goes down snacks reveals himself and now shirou with the a1s trying to throw himself between the two he's got the kit to work with he's going to have to double back and just immediately get on bomb Nico may be smoked off but it's just not there shirou has to let it slide and G2 hang on yeah wow nice nice kill there from both Nico and snacks actually they didn't get one each after what happened yesterday but I fear that they're oh getting better that doesn't Land uhoh good damage but it's just the one kill shirou that was surprising I thought that hit Hunter's going to have a One V One queued up oh you got to get that what the hell it gets away from topper Peaks out from heaven and clears one off the bomb site MP9 he's planting solo to make a difference honestly makes a bit of noise as the CTS group up inside of storage can he change position from here can he get any further off the site does he even need to does Nico come forward with that flashbang to try to bail him out once the retake starts cuz they're quietly getting closer yes sir The Flash does indeed connect Monas he takes one to the head he gets drop to 17 clutch has the B from Nico hits the heaven kill falls back beautiful Bo wow and right back into the action to close it man if there's two guys that are going to be able to win a 2v3 consistently it's it's on a level sure if they stick together I think it's on another level okay let's hope it keeps it there frag grenade for Shiro doesn't get thrown out so they get past camera no problem and there's the two entries comes in at the right moment not bad Shiro coupling it with a peak and dropping Nico with a quick burst of the SMG bomb has been planted what's Don got to say about it posted on the storage exit but that smoke grenade over towards long is just going to keep Magic's out of the round and so they're waiting for the exits and this is G2 to go up six to three they got the memo heading back to a I think the coolest part is oh wait they got to be careful with this op back what the heck terrorists win everyone's still on the site confirming Magic's position Dong's been kind of getting owned here playing on the B site see if that changes now playing back default is a little different usually where magic stands oh there it is Chopper actually ends up falling victim to it instead right that was the op that's been set up all this time waiting and waiting for donk to step into it but Chopper takes the bullet for him Don can hang on to Obelisk alongside magic the two of them here to hold but mobs ad n the rifle Shine for G2 no kill and he goes down on the road to an e t round win and spirit disjointed at the moment ztics and shirro going to have to come through clutch separated but getting closer no kit between them at the moment and Shiro finds Nico that's a big pick there's the kid on the ground so that'll be scooped up on the approach to the bomb and the kill comes out from zanic so each of the CTS offering one up in this 2v3 Mony can you close sure enough fing ztics goes in and that forward position from Shiro catches him off guard that was very smart from chiro he got really into the doorway instead of making it seem like he was going to fake and then take a passive angle and play the jumping game with Mony let him swing let the boy swing just get in there I mean think about how he used to play even dark here on Anubis right he used to be maybe a little too in your face at times down water yeah very comparable to Mirage once upon a time but we go back and forth or so Spirit had hoped instead they just go down by two out of the gate minute 30 and it's a 3v5 for Spirit to try and claim a fifth round that's the last piece of util right there between these two a Defenders that solo flashbang so going to have to bank on Shiro's off but currently burned out of both bricks and Heaven can't really go for a Peak couldn't stop snack from crossing over Way by himself right now snack lets go of the thought of a player in sight though so it is a single player they're all going to rotate now so just donk here for the second but it's understood at this point these are all moving in tuck in Temple player swings Chopper trying to serve up that distraction serves up damage too and the plat Peak from Don is good Nico's dead Mon's found an answer NOS he's got him locked into the corner but a Miss shot 7 into the clock he's got to go deep for bomb and it's not going to happen backto back clutches for shirou so Spirit take another rotations are starting to come out towards middle they're both going to attack there four players about to come in here dues could be everything oh in the pocket Perfection snacks what three I wonder if Hunter still calls the pistol rounds that was a thing for a while for a while yeah that he calls all the pistol rounds and they also had a really great pistol round percentage counterterrorist win I also a part of me just still never believed that like it was some kind of like that was some kind of like sop you know cuz it does just sound insane that he would just call pistols snacks what do you he doesn't even see him yeah their head tohe head hasn't been like too highlighted so far on Anubis but in terms of performance it's Nico doing better than Don yet again Hunter here to support as they go barreling out towards B oh Mon's flash still affecting Don as he tries to come out and get the trade frag it's a double kill out of the gate here for G2 being very brave in their approach with the offense when he was solo like you look at Mony in the spot and you know he's going to make something of this oh that's huge big one from snack that cuts off one of the Avenues of attack for spirit so two players out from long looking to get it going but the flashbang makes it a little awkward and in that moment Hunter strikes Shiro's position found out G2 to double digits and I mean Brave out of the gate with the double push or I've seen this before they set up outside of that b site and then Chopper at a moment is going to try to jump across the angle but this is Mony holding a little bit wider he can actually track this yeah before it was Z way far back on a sliver so you could only watch it yep and last time it worked this time it puts pressure on Spirit to get into the B site with nobody actually succeeding out mid what was man Advantage goes 4v4 MBS bit of pressure through smoke but not panicking capitalizing as Don was throwing out util but the Young Gun survives oh there's the head shots that's what you've been waiting for Hunter applies pressure into dark dealing with the player on the backline and as he goes looking for more he'll falter there's damage coming through as Don and Shiro sit on 10 Health a pop but this is Spirit cracking into the B bomb site yes sure Chopper doesn't get the success in middle that we saw versus Vitality but Don doubles down that's the perfect example of setting up in a post plant where they've got the smoke down on the right side they have players holding down the other choke points for him so he can focus forward on the only Gap and there's definitely an approach Chopper at the front of it Miss shot from Mony it's cover Don gets the head shot to Nico swap out from mon good damage but again doubling down yeah that's two key frags and we weren't getting those instantaneous head shots out of the gate but now he's starting to connect them in multiple rounds and if he can string those together Spirit are going to start to get something underneath them on this tside 30 seconds to the clock bomb of course can go into the a site with no contest donk giving critical cover to get Spirit one round closer they're going slow but there's no CTS here to really fight they're going for the long save back in spawn and every drop in the bucket that goes back to the favor of Don over Nico in the head-to-head is going to slowly erase that narrative that Nico's got his number yeah but he is he's like two to one down it's a lot it's going to take a while few games for sure suddenly then it's going to draw Mony off middle they're still going back a things get unraveled you would have liked to see spirit with some mid control early on to help with this situation but ni oh everyone just dies what just happened that's Don baby gets the head to-head another drop in the bucket followed up by the Shiro op shot bomb has we want to talk about fun Duos man you know Don and Shiro are supposed to be the counterparts of Nico and Mony definitely and it was that huge out of nowhere signing Shiro departing the Cloud9 project to join the likes of Don to join forces with a prodigy and this round is the talent that shines through yeah that's pretty solid that was the system working at its finest there with all the pressure in place to even do yeah they've been crafting mid setups they just don't have like the utility right now I think okay at least the flash nearly did something oh careful don't write off Nico's deagle 57 goes down oh that was a collat I think Shiro slides out Nico nearly dead but still alive and kicking two healths enough for Nico oh nice shot from Ms two on two now with MLS on the other side bomb is still back in spawn Don's going to scoop that up we've got total a control and ztics going deep will find the head shot doesn't get caught off guard by Nico that's enough to again just secure the plant let Don come and join you you'd think but there's hesitation here to which direction Don commits yeah I'm like kind of like looking forward to showing you so terrorists win i f felt bad cuz that enthusiasm didn't match the start of the game but uh he has come into His Zone throughout the tside now we're getting that wonder if they have an inkling of this push donk walking up underneath it and yes he will sus this out quickly no support from mon he had already given up that doorway no safe way to do it if you're not going to hold lot of utility here for Nico as well so he knows he'd run a risk if he wants to try to take any kind of peak so they're just going to bank on Mony holding it and he will shirro walks into the scope oh fast Chase he knows what he wants and he goes ahead to take it for the man Advantage fast move from Nico but he gets caught off guard from the immediate rep peek of zonx sure presence over towards long but hunter is given a chance to slot in behind plat unnoticed now the question is do they even have to go here they must know now that most CTS are in these exact rotation spots they've cleared out water behind them it's just a matter of do they want to waste the time but if they come in there's no Molly just that Chopper smoke ztics starting to size up the site again turning back behind him no presence shown anywhere else from G2 Everything feels a little too quiet Hunter goes for the peak to get get in with impact snack connects his spray from the back plat denied ztics and snacks to clutch for 12 okay he'll grab it was is there a Flash there that someone dropped taken over mid with no resistance Mony blinded has to offer up across oh Chopper thought he could walk back into that but mesty ready you gave him the warning sign and he's good to go don tries to then just tear up the same route into the B bomb site why not he's done it multiple times he can very well do this yet again and magix is going to offer up a helping hand must be Hunter he leans back with fire at his feet donk out in the open dead so Shiro comes through with a little impact and a fake plant he gets stopped Nico straight up blasted back by Magic's man Advantage here for spirit and a commitment off of the bomb plant with coverage on both sides monesy slips up does he have it in him it's overtime on the line in a post plant in a 1v3 and they don't know where he's at he Peaks wide and no sir it's the perimeters held back magic can't believe it him and ztics cover and we go OT yeah OT after all that that was uh that was incredible for magic that first kill I don't think he even saw anything and I mean Don's entries into that b site that's why Spirit were able to maintain tside momentum that's why they're in OT now that and a little sprinkle in of Pizzaz from Magic Shiro ready for that wow they did read it the one time but the last time they routed to kill Ms first here they prepare for the Mony push push and Ms is still out here which is actually kind of crazy I mean yeah they they cleared it they cleared it perfectly that's we have to look at comparison of stalk CT to T side at this point because like 22 and 7 looks okay but you watch the whole game hold on oh it's a clean start but there it is okay zic still just going to pick up a bit of slack because running two players through smoke with a Molotov that bounces off of the wall awkwardly could have gotten worse nicely done from ztics haven't really had to say his name doesn't make Mon's job easy so he repositions this time around tries to take the boost on snacks but doesn't make contact ztics oh wow gets found out on the side of smoke nicely done here from snack trying his absolute damnest to break that curse 36 maps in a row with a negative KD will it be 37 quality not quantity perhaps as he picks up a critical 5v4 opening through smoke 40 seconds and again this fixation from Spirit on Mid Eco spot you know it's a very committed position comes down to whether or not he pops out at the right time if he commits here will he get two oh he could ruin their day look real good pops up does indeed get a double Chopper finds the return frag then there's problems for Chopper on a and bomb down in the process that is all Nico and what do you know it works that's excellent so late into the round to be sitting there and just having an inkling that maybe they try this walk up mob's about to get aggressive outside of B there's a lot of bodies on the other side flash is good he gets one but dou down and that was what got the ball going into that b site so regularly in regulation what do you know ztics ready for the drop of Nico that same play worked previously for Nico this time it's predicted and this time it's Spirit to go up 4v2 smokes come over top of the wall three player pack on Long ready to go Monas is going to have to show us some fireworks and he's going to have to do it alone just like that okay ready for more making a movie with two more players ahead nobody can stop it oh my God light The Flash and thunder wi disgusting save Don for last and we got it on film this first when he hits that you know he's got it all that was revenge for what shirou did to him let's go God I love that reaction the kind of individual level that we are absolutely hoping for when G2 and spirit lock horns not only do we get this back and forth head-to-head between Don and Nico but now Monas is bringing it and with the quick trade out towards middle Nico going to try to keep moving forward here Chopper Falls all the way back and one for Mony keeping that pressure on quietly was hit 30 seconds yeah I think the activity is constant the pressure is high and Don delivers denying Mony any chance to get impact here is 15 is right ahead of G2 but they've been coralled into an a sight a walkr smoke from Chopper Nico just takes his head off easy and we go back 2v2 they have to get the bomb down oh Shiro's caught Don's going to try to keep going but they know it he still prevails the head-to-head over Nico how is he to take that one back fire at the feet but prevails and it's 15 G2 first oh Chopper walked through the smoke Don was out there with him wait for your best guy to go through nobody pounces on the flash but the numbers are here for Spirit they're going fast into this play three players here though up close on jail Hunter tries to pounce and he will prevail Don's dead and Don's dead who's going to pick up that slack it's magix with the op in the middle of it all and he can't even track the player push Chopper dead at the hands of mobs who stands tall to deliver alongside Mony finally Don gets the better of Nico and G2 still tap in with another great rifle MLBs to make the difference perhaps we go 4v2 into the post plant G2 surviving the test into overtime off of the back of Mony heroics he's always got one of these amazing entry rounds at the end of a game ztics clipped and poor Shiro Waits out the smoke he offered up the clutches to push us to OT but this one too much to ask Mony magnificent and just the right amount of malice it's going to connect at some point and it begins with the brettas but Mony double glock head shot oh they thought they were going to take the fight to G2 instead they get laid out on the front of the a shirou and Don down Mony jumping Berettas he's going to ace this no ztics is finally going to have not even going to win actually yeah he's got to maybe I got ahead of myself you know the pistol praise was sung by sto coming out with the stats right ahead of this one going live snacks and Nico task to close it they're going to do exactly that because I I agree with sto you got a hell of a pistol core Trio the the the ARs are got weaker and weaker as time actually that's not true asrs was the strongest overall but they kind of stopped there when uh the game got more figured out but I mean just mathematically would make sense right mr12 more mathematically yeah to be math guy for a second but there' be more parody but the parody has been really fun can't deny it it's making for a exciting end of the year as we have World Finals with no na'vi in the grand finals that much guaranteed my God who would have thought coming into Singapore that they'd be the first team to fall terrorist win not this guy bomb hased first last place exit I think elanar tweeted out that since 2019 yep for na'vi and first a lot of different teams but first time losing their Opening match at a tournament since katav all kinds of Records not the good ones ztics dead Hunter's going to double down nice double entry on his own for the most part there was support but it wasn't needed g2r frying yeah there's just there's something in the water now you know this is to me this is like the the boiling over of map one bomb has been planted I felt like G2 were always going to start hot on Mirage doesn't mean Spirit are out of this but uh there's no doubt in my mind that G2 riding the momentum mhm yeah they've got us they've got a better win rate so far G2 a lot of confidence they picked this map Anubis was on paper the harder part not that the series was going to be easy oh dude what is what are the what are the shots being hit yeah yeah a lot of good shots being hit from the oppers okay okay M man on the chair back at least by Dons but donks singular donk there's only one feels like must be two guys it's just two little guys in a trench coat one guy on the mouse one guy on the keyboard that's donk they're like meatos there two Maui snakes in there yelling at each other yeah apologizing Nico's going to try to slide forward into the same slot that Ms did out the gate but CTS have other ideas and the pressure's good Don comes through all donk three kills into the round you can feel that one everybody sizing each other up but there's still legs in the round G2 go ahead attempt this B hit saw the entries from Hunter last time monest is going to put that scope up on catwalk if needed it was worried about Mark it but jumps over gets tagged deals with Don first and with Don down you're telling me he can't do this oh but he gets a little bogged down by the weapon swapping and shirou capitalizes on the moment that was insane man not going to lie I like almost everyone versus everyone right now like G2 FaZe Spirit na'vi oh s about these individuals and well he dresses up and bullets a 61 damage on two players but they both don't go down takes three players inside of that smoke after he kills Mony to get the trade out he does a bunch of damage too so well done by Don softens up the bunch he starts to leave just as they start to exit ramp shirro gives up the angle Chopper position though is going to catch one off guard sure enough snacks will kill shirou at the very least snacks off seconds missed quick scope trying his damnedest to be Mony but those are big shoes to fill mhm during liquid versus Vitality see if Hunter can pull one out of oh oh yeah he can't well that's Nico but godam one's been pulled that's when you know too many angles Hunter then capitalizing climbing up through window felt like he wanted to kind of seize that moment last round look at the guns man this is still a salvageable position Chopper killing m depends on Chopper's awareness right now picks his fights properly he has a couple of easy ones they're just some big threats on the other side with small guns they're playing with him he's trying to keep his head down as the desert Eagles ring out all around him his supports here ztics now from the back and a crossfire set up as magix moves out this is definitely savable salvageable by Chopper who serves up a great distraction Nico's going to find another deagle kill they know they have him pinned on default though but it's Nico and Mony alive Nico come on gave him a good fight right there the shoulder Peak comes in the plant goes down and now bomb hased Magic's at least they might not be sure exactly where he's coming from oh there he goes getting spot jump on it but it's an AK here for Mony so Nico trying to move over and not even needed triple deagle round from Nico wow that was the first and final boss right it's the guy that Chopper saw and then he went to take out two of his friends and then Nico was still there the whole time causing problems just sat on that bad boy waited it was just that one shot that brought the attention for Hunter to be able to sneak in through window wers what do you think it's like to be [Applause] talented shuffling around slightly but not yet making the mistake as the other pieces of G2 get into position to support Mony he's still just going to stay waiting but then timing oh nice snap ztics and he gets snacks too monster truly Mony left on 13 HP ztics job done it's not the best spot to be in here for magix but you know what the MP9 maybe better than sitting on the site and he'll get pushed to the Cross wanted to take that duel Hunter definitely trying to bring the fight in map two especially mhm as he goes up 74 but it's ni to lose out to Don and with Don's 19 points of Health mon still going to get the of him now Chopper coming back from ramp that could catch Mony off guard it should indeed he's got that bomb planting it front sight does it go down in time oh it goes down in time yes he dies but at least it's been planted here for Hunter shirou comes up catwalk Hunter is indeed in a solid spot they know it's not Palace they know he must be around connector right surely we'll see but he could be jungle he could be bought a mid for as all shirro knows and in STS is pretty crazy Mak Ave that step now Shiro's getting closer behind him he gets wall banged at that he tries to get around it he's got a chance to get out but Shiro chases him down all's good is there a kit he he should have never come close to winning that after the damage that Shiro did through the the wall nice try for Hunter right no kit oh no kit oh he's got it okay yeah not even close oh nice Kill from Nico and that's [Applause] a feather in the cap in the head-to-head versus Don Chopper trying to give himself space to work as Magic's gets the one and done so man advantage and they're starting to set eyes on the site Shiro's already here though and ztics comes running over what's snack heard and what's he going to call Shiro is more concerned about middle and that could be all they need to just get over boy and ztics able to get the Kill from cat snack makes his presence known goes down to 9 HP now that's a player unaccounted for oh they still found him and monesy gets his angle mob's going to try to cross over to ticket running the risk of jumping over but all's good again you know snacks is removed from the equation for the time being and Mony missing shots continues to give Spirit a bit of a chance here waiting and waiting and not able to deliver this time around snacks will be killed and Ms was spotted earlier jumping across towards ticket surely but I guess not theyve lost track of it ZX oh down to a second misses molds can't slash him and dies after the fact a robbery from ztics too far to the left and too far to the right Z's been leaving a mark on G2 with the cap plays he's going to run the risk of going out but snack is going to hold him keep him honest from down beneath window beautiful deagle from MBS it's crazy that he brings deagle Firepower to a lineup like G2 you've got to respect it climb up from Magic's punished as Hunter another kill in that same spot damn he really has kind of been like the ztics of B for G2 who even won the last round look at the buys that are coming through it was that defuse with one player left that's right that's right sorry I got you thinking about Opera GX and you forget the round results ter win what do you know throws him his hat into the ring and posts 10 kills so far in this half with very critical once opening up that b site multiple rounds MLS finds shirro bottom under pass that's where that kill went down he missed his very important timing on that Peak sh usually really good and in that position but outdone a bit by Ms who's just just a bit too careful but what happens here I mean are we going to have that we have snacks pick up smoke or okay picks up a bullet between the eyes Don gets the better of him not afraid of playing in Middle Nico better be careful he's carrying bomb right now solo oh nope mobs is with him right on him yeah and as MLS tries to push along the smoke with him oh Don falling still recovers with the dink after after the fact you find Don falling with inaccuracy and he still manages but they're still going B to leave a mark we get zonic sliding in behind van MP9 in hand 30 HP all he's got to work with or the incendiary at this time in the round could stop them they just got to wait for mon mly that'll put a bit more pressure on Burn some precious time off the clock they disrespect it in the end ztics out to Hunter who's able to slide down behind that's aom clean 5 S kill they've got time to go back but it does indeed cause a problem Oh and it serves up a perfect distraction but monesy will still kill magix he's got to go plant very low Health 13 HP and knows where Chopper was at 10 to the clock does he even go for the plant yeah he Taps it once to fake it out Chopper goes and gets the head shot winning rounds for Spirits yeah it feels like there was almost no way if Chopper had gotten around the other side of the site for the tie score spirit so close everyone's just been so broke every round here we go trying to pick up the pace towards connector donks not having any of that take it to the top of the board for spirit yet again Nico trying to tap back into that deagle potential but couple Miss shots Hy finds ztics on catwalk prepared for the Don Peak and then the window player is the one that ends him shirou the third piece of the puzzle Nico creeps out doesn't think about oh he looks missed it both Miss oh and he doesn't get his kill magic still saves it shirou lucky to be alive as he takes deagle shots to the back of the head or body rather get this apartment's push from Chopper another key move from Chopper I love sometimes the way Chopper plays things just slots into the right spot at the right time it's not always flashy but it'll put too much pressure on snacks to handle here sitting at the bottom of the board and sure enough Spirit surely taking this sixth round so another moment where Don goes swinging out of the gate into connector another round that could have been if Nico's Desert Eagle does indeed get its Target But ultimately Spirit going to add two rounds to the end to tie this you'd think give snacks the benefit of the doubt bomb planted Chopper gave him that space wants his teammates to come through they're going to minimize mistakes it's called clean Counter Strike there we go done and dusted as you'd expect 40 the start for G2 as they came out of a nubis with a blistering pace and more individual level but at the end of the day Spirit Prevail and this game still on and he thinks it's why I hate that charm placement it's kind of Tri for some reason you you Dro me a gun and there's a charm on the end like that oh we're not friends it's making me feel weird oh wow is that going to count ni you're going to count FRS like that yeah yeah Nico's like yep that's another say got your ass they're going to go interrupted dude the bomb's not planted settle down Shiro on default trying to do it all but okay he can't two kills is all he gets you kind of don't want to let them plant the bomb though they're they're on to something they knew it was about to get planted that means one guy's hands busy you know exactly where he is plus his teammates are on high alert trying to cover him get in there and don't worry folks snack's got the kit that's a team player it's important just in case oh man they don't they don't know someone's here they'll it's okay it's just a Glock oh my God he really worked on him of course the Peak at some Point's going to El so they can actually plant here safely Ms doesn't pounce doesn't see anybody on the approach so now bombs down good thing snacks B the kit and as they push out towards bench they get two of the four kills needed taking backman advantage yes MLBs is low you got shirro still however in this clutch Chopper is going to see if he can set him up but two Miss deagle shots doesn't bode well here for shirou that kit preoccupied over on connector dealing death to Chopper now you've got shirro locked in the kit can get on top of the bomb the deagle connects but he's not thinking about the kit he doesn't predict it and so snack buys the kit and it does make a difference yeah true it all mattered they kept an eye on that last Rotator in little aggression out connector oh careful Nico just how much you looking for cuz there's a couple bodies ready for you top mid and one for Doo yeah unless he leaves before they get there him even showing up here is just going to keep him around so this this works out actually pretty damn well for Spirit even if he dies Kill from Mony at least but of course by the time Hunter realizes what's going down that b bomb site's going to have a plant on it oo Hunter's got a timing though yeah ooh and damage on top of that Don down to 30 they underestimated out quickly they could be there is it enough for G2 to try and pull this one off no they're already forfeiting the round and spirit will be given a seven ooh and an extra gun gets knocked down that's mobs maack might want to come grab that in a second if there's not one on the site which out there should be yeah there was uh Chopper keeps up the jigle but he's allowed for him to get really close start contrast to the round prior where Nico's going for the top mid wide swing Don's going to disrespect that you think a smoke is going to stop him come on now come on now up into connector catching Mony in the background we'll see if the cap player can do anything to stop it they know he's still in here and but the thing is 38 seconds Don is going to see nothing yeah and there's a still a chance they peel back under no the bomb's too committed Niko gets his they can spot the window they could fall back seriously they they do have time duns and window sees nothing oh they're they're not making the right decision though they're they're just going to go back to it with less time they kind of stall out for a second you know the opportunity was there the possibility was there but they decide not to seize it ztics sees both in sight no trade 7 seconds and guess what somebody creeping out in the corners so that one's going to drop the bomb and make this round fizzle out Don trying strike him down even out of chance there before time expired they both die in fact and honestly those DS could have happened with 2 seconds left toer didn't turn around go under pass then come back if they had just committed to that b play originally or committed to the a play both were better options than what they just did I mean how much could Chopper do to really keep them down there little support from the connector player to try and draw them back oh but Z and Chopper both finding a kill a pop cuz Hunter tried to peek his head up over towards the B apartments and that's going to force Mony to try to move over I don't think Spirit are going to rush this yeah they shouldn't because that was five dead last round so now they got G2 on the ropes if they win this round cleanly again people are winning with not much to work with not even going to say this 3v5 is out of the question you still got the three best players on the team left alive I say that 100 top of the board but okay way they come back get TR back in position Mony gets himself a double they know there's another player there no way one trade on two players on a site one guy with an MP9 Spirit you can't let these ones go he's not been spotted actually so Ms is never going to leave at some point they're going to have to win a duel versus him and it frees up Mony to go peeking wide makes contact versus both por Shiro down to 58 HP 7 Seconds to the clock no chance you'd think but muls is dead and of course Mony just dodging him long enough don't die after time shirou going to try to hang on keeps himself tucked Nico won't find the angle from the cat Peak so G2 take a 10th in a round that it felt like Spirit were just going to play to Perfection going to have to find a back door with a buy like this smoke and a flash all they have to play with one of which goes out as Nico finds opening kills towards ramp it's an easy stairs Peak for him but also concerned about middle and you should be this AK is in the mix he won't hide he won't shy away from it he's going to Blindside shirro in a second so AK goes down will forget about the third that crawl out from ztics going to activate grab an M4 with an opening kill and an attempt at a 2v5 it is such a good spot to be in if you want to like make something happen having window but I mean who's going to show themselves 37 to make this happen and everybody's still close enough to play off someone else right nice could they did do it now they've got two left but it's still a player inside a holding on to the default MBS didn't see him he could still just play this down calmly as they push forward yep unsuspectingly catching him off guard oh he'll get di back by ztics but it's a kill towards cat and a kill towards ticket Chopper continues to make this mid presence consistent we saw Nico open up with a kill on ramp one round to go ztics here to try and stop that from happening but mobs has got his number and they don't even know about the numbers ni and Ms not showing any skin 20 seconds yet again but because one round to go mobs caught him off on default no surprise that they're cautious on the approach but it's not Ms so sure enough yes keep your guard up that's why they go for the palace Molly making sure no one can swing 7 Seconds can't fake get a PL magic commits the spam comes by him and everybody with kits no grenades G2 4 V3 and a slow burn here for snacks looking to activate after his teammates once that smoke Fades on ticket you think this one gets rolling and Ms even finding Magics in the No Man's Land that's just good timing waits for the Molly to burn out obviously they thought about his position a dink comes off the top of ticket so Don's job made harder but him and Shiro still able to connect with the kill a PO Don not able to double down as G2 come clean with the trade frags to go up to 12 crazy good for M man if he dies right there Don has a way out so incredible that he hits that head shot putting guala on the map go through the bottom of connector Don making the most of it just before it pops gets vision of Mony and this map ain't over baby it is a flurry of kills coming out to the favor of spirit doesn't finish what he started can't hit the desk you could try it will bite back yes five map and match points for G2 but the first one slips by with just honestly a good nice bit of aggression Don keeping the pressure on cat not cat excuse me con and uh not the first time either that Mony kind of gets his head taken off that quickly by Don oh Don continues to be solid here overall terrorists win he was good in the first half good in the second it's not the hyper carry that we saw last map but even that wasn't enough so the moment Spirit they're not avoiding this right it's not like anybody's walking out ramper Palace this is actually playing into the hand of this setup we see if any guns exchange hands Mon's Berettas connect but then Shiro's trade is good and he's there on both sides I'm trying to see are they here to play right now like Spirit they worked back from the score line on Anubis knife kill you know everybody dies which one no sorry I'm mixing up rounds the rounds terrorist round where everybody dies that was yesterday three players backside is cute but still Spirit might still have an advantage we'll see if they approach this correctly half Health Magic's able to get past the first window snack takes damage too this is not ideal but the CT is looking to hang on N connects the kovat brothers going to get sidelined by Don if Nico found out but he just buys the perfect amount of time Don is in the corner Nico's going to Peak loses his head but both these Spirit players dinked monesy and MBS into the 2v2 with a huge Health Advantage but enough space for bomb to go down Don he's going head hunting he's going to go deep on cat he's going to take what he wants as he goes in with a third kill in this round and he D swaps over to the op now MLS is going to have a Health Advantage but that op does it lock it in oh he's toing with it and M Just Nails the head sh G2 over top of spirit yet again that is nasty from MLS he knows that it's the op or something holding him perfectly and he puts one in the dome one of many for MS
