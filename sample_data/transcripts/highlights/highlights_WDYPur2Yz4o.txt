and that is basically just caveated with the responsive does Cloud9 even have that they haven't won an official in nearly 50 days on HL TVJ yeah it's not been great for them they need to try and turn that back around relatively soon preferably in this particular match up to stay with elimination and stay in the Thunder pick World Championship as the pistols do kick off Martinez is drawing out first Blood v n z on the CT side goose down on dgt will keep him similarly low HP is now there's a kill coming in towards CT spawn heavy God has dropped ICC do take that trade back and the a site is now on The Siege the bomb plant could come down the CTS are rotating in the M Advantage though and Cloud9 want to fight against the rotators and that's why they're taking all of this space boom is very aggressive with the bomb you've got in as a bit of a bait unfortunately the CTS are trying to fight on from Spawn and now that bomb's even been seen trying to get out of window room one for one trades will still keep the advantage in for 9 Z the bomb make his way downstairs in the underpass position for bomit into's almost cting dgt is low HP so that could be an easy trade and it does come through in the end so back to even we go that bomb's Crossing into very risky territory though bu is around the corner in actually SE him coming through the murder hole so Cloud n holding their nerve and holding them out Advantage now Max in a one versus two if he goes through this murder hole he will just drop to inters locking swings and he's dead to right inter will take the final kill and the pistol will be recovered by Cloud n big green guns out early from the CP side it seems to be a contact in from a main bu and has a peak's going to be up against the ram walk at the moment C the are to try block them away from Ram they able to isolate one individual but axile gets the opening Kill Max is trying to respond two kills in for axile in is going to follow it up so Cloud n getting the kills is appropriate dgt lets One play cross right past CT doesn't end up pulling that trigger from short one will make his way towards the bomtom site either way it's a Twan Advantage for Cloud9 so shouldn't be a retake for n a good work for the entries from Cloud9 just completely collapsed the bomb site you mentioned the pathway of qualifying here to thunder pick I would say that Cloud9 even got tested by the majority of tier 2 teams I'm thinking back to their quarterfinal match up against alternate attacks lost map number one 14 to 16 all rifles all out for both sides of course Max lost bonus for the CT forces so Martinez is going to get right back on the awp with the m Falls across everybody else that's in mid for booming are going to try and push that Orit back as well unable to get started on the Big Green aide again walking out of ramp here going to take a fight on first PE going to get taken down for it here go with a decent frag to return Martinez is or is posted for a swing and he gets exactly what he wishes for and finally you have the adaptation for the CTS being ready for that walk out on eight and tried it once and it was successful but tried it the second time and it was cancelled try and get a pick towards that con player maybe one of the individuals deep in CT if Martinez flashed in iy peaks with the and gets Martinez to drop so man Advantage for 9 Z taken back to evens by Cloud 9 the flank of inter will start to close in maxy connect to the H has come down he's back he's turned towards the sight but he does find in for his trouble so Advantage regain but the bomb will go down here bu now out towards CT spawn boom is backed up where they might making their way in good Flash in but it can it blinds off B more than anything else for boom he gets that kill forward and the USP is pulled out for the player over the W stairs dgt is taking down icy boom needs a rifle Firepower right here but he's out of and dgt is going to catch him trying to get back to another AK in the end the kill will come through and in the end the retake will be successful for N9 Z start for them now finally found can they return all the deficit against Cloud9 is the next question took a lot of damage in that round so the SMG for budha is going to be the weak in element Martinez however finally going to get the opening kill there he's been biting for all game long up to the apartment that going to get caught and Max swinging in boage jumps face hero Wings Of Glory and Max is dead to rights but pure RNG has won at least an opening kill there for Cloud9 you will be kicking himself at top mid because now we're starting to see the charge up of rifle damage in Ms great pre- aim there for heavy God no luck involved in that kill 30 seconds for him to defend what seems to be the be split look up to app smokes down and connect blind fire can take B with his teammate though the orot my not on the first shot second one lines up a collateral kill and inters will drop for it icy turning back to Martinez makes it a two versus two at least and now they hold the bomb plant they hold the bomb site I in very low HP though dgt looked like he wanted to go under pass but he's going to change the position up get out towards short you've got budha coming into the apartments it's going to take a while for this retake to get set up in this 2v2 dgt making his way into Market AK pulled out heavy go was trying to prod but he's not going to go so far as to extend towards the market entrance in the doorway he looks he makes noise giving heavy go the info he requires incendiary from Buddha is going to reveal his position and with no more backup there is no more chance not a kit in sight so no retake available Cloud n hell of a response the South American Squad instantly back on the back foot without a chance to close that Gap Cloud number six right here the AK in from boom is going to spot two take one of them out before he heavy go swings toward under pass and is going to get dealt with under Trad aile continues trade advantage for the P side and trying to isolate a player on sh is caught looking the wrong way at the wrong time on the sight though in fighting from range tapping his way to Victory but not quite finishing the job budha with a double from range icy is in a 1 V2 how's he not got that kill I just lost for words that is an absolute sitter for iners in which he puts down about 20 bullets at least icy can recover this round he knows the boot toward short he knows from his teammate that he's got to be fairly low so get rid of the or and move out to the rifle smoke up as well a suppress from con one versus one at this stage Buddha going to make his way forward utility is in his hands no kit on him I don't know if there were any drop towards mid that he can recover if so he's going to have to go back and grab them and there might not be enough time for that I cleared out CT spawn smokes up towards the plant position landing on top of the Firebox will spread three qus the time have ticked away budha on site tapping it once icy would just tap his way through get the tags and in the end get the kill and hold the clut so little bit DIY for a moment but Cloud n do hit number six something to consider when it comes to the playoff stages and the land if Cloud n get there execution towards the B bomb site fast plays out molotov in h will try block them they are staggered for a moment dgt actually assisting heavy God's Own suicide burning in his own moloto and following up as well with Buddha kill for ax off finally returns one pick and I or can turn onto a second look up towards the back of this bench position Buddha his USP is doing absolute work damage on both individuals down to 15 and seven this teammate and Max closing in the bat lines only a matter of time before ice is going to get picked up nine out have won this round indeed they have very good stall out on the bottom side and you're right about that USP just some sick damage being landed from the bench area terrorist eventually AAR forced into the open trying to evade the nade right running right into the awp struggle to win their map pick you have to go 5 to S you've got to really stall these rounds out and give very few chances over to Cloud n got the buy up to do so oh what a shot for iy just barely saw Max before the smoke bloomed looking in against Martinez as well flash on the corner or to Peak and wins the fight for the CT side instead you've got boom has picked up the awp and this is where now your underpass player God can put pressure onto the Ora because Martinez didn't quite reposition because he didn't go more defensively heavy God has just constantly worked this short pick or con pick or even into window he's been a danger man Buddha if he goes aggressive he'll lose that fight to Axel rounds completely over so dgt is going to rotate out to the bench you're going to have H so Peak thinking about a rotate too so this just looks like it's transitioning into a gamble stack SMG finds the fight on axile so they can defend for that one casualty R from get picked up by BU as well but you're right about this gamble stack it was letting in towards that b bomb site they are going to try and look for some sort of returning three versus three been taken here by Cloud n though so 9 Z maybe sneak in the bomb planter he's just seen there CT spawn no doesn't end up going for it ASA wait for his teammates to move in towards the backat lines here towards connector in particular for budha HS will dish out a tiny amount of damage nothing major boom has got himself into a good PA out here from Tetris but the CTS are already on the bomb side bombs opened up though come forward quick s boom secondary has to get taken by inas Buddha trades it back one versus one HP Advantage for heavy God on the diffuse he holds heavy God's got a peek right now he's not going to make it in time he does they hold the round again for cloud n this was the map that cloud n should have been able to uh at least have the better basis on their pick and all their best the pool they are making a statement with that best as well one for one trayes already into round 12 felt very much like a formality half more than anything else here for them for number 10 when n z have gotten very little out of these advantages Hile will get caught into so fast on the trade and now it's just up to the Jungle players to defend heavy God consistently working underpass so they'll know that it'll be around here somewh the problem is when does he strike it's always on the timing perfect on Bo up and Max frowned as well by in Cloud I making light work and n z this map Performance might at least shift a couple ahead back that direction 102 at the turn a wonderful opening half from Cloud9 that jump face for trying to get the necessary Vision put that fire down as soon as he does minute on on the clock for them to make their move here they come blocking out the they're going to push forward of it damage going to be sponged by dgt and martinz one kill does go the way of axar him and in have been mowed down bomit good head shot on dgt Crossing towards the bomb site Max with a returning frag out the outside of the apartments and I and heavy God two versus three two players that you could rely on for cloud n in this kind of clock situation but gu against ice limited he still gets Mar on the way out the round now it's on to heavy God now two to find and make his moves in quick and Loud from short Max swinging forward just barely seeing his shoulder Buddha unknown Taps on that shoulder Damage Done both players at half HP or less for 9 Z and heavy God's got to make a move in quick he hasn't got a kit right here seen towards the apartment player a shoulder of budha peeking out more damage being done but he needs these kills and he needs them fast it might not be fast enough at this stage too long taking the time will bite Cloud n and N9 Z will get a pistol it's a really well played 2V1 cuz none of them are over peaking they're jiggling slightly so they can keep attention on and they can make sure they keep internally having a rough idea of where he is still plenty to be positive about for cloud n though it's one out of total of eight that N9 Z will need to recover to bring the lead back forces in from Cloud 9 as well ready to receive Ice's already tagged up Martin is UNA we're not ready for Max to come in from connected control hearing grimage going to spray him down his teammate of axile will finally get that responsive but the range game with the rifles are working well against against these pistols and Mac 10s or MP9 rather inters with a range shot with the deagle from that short position a two versus three will ensue G can get picked up a heavy God but very difficult one to win a bit of a weird timing that the Scout from Icy was maintaining stairs kind of fighting towards RAB fighting in the palace players drops down in COD and just dies it's like how how's there a tside player there Martinez having one out for his own part going to have the bomb on his back as well and joining his team for the execution towards the a bomb site it looks promising for Cloud 9 you've got two players on a and a third player from heavy God that can rotate up quickly from con first Molly to under dark boom just getting on the other side of it on the balcony for on Boom nicely both go down so quickly for dgt and Buddha damage being done to dgt in that exchange just budha just makes a quick swing on heavy God great reach from nine z in Cloud n down by three players I mean Hind and axile just have to save it's such an expense to go for the double LS and neither of them produce any impact at all the first initial contact on the exe just mowing down entries this last rifle by Cloud9 to keep it all held together they are set in to the defensive heavy handed over on the a side of the map and there's utility coming in from Max and Martinez to indicate the fast execution the bombs back there as well D GT is not looking a strike neither is Max two players in mid will be allowed full rain mid and eventually they will to try and commit match with a kill on Boom dgt bursting from Beyond that smoke and just getting enough Vision to catch axile off guard heavy God now holds it sandwich and almost holds completely alone in on the other side of the site is hiding behind the danger box and the t's are closing in ever so slowly from connector players coming in icy will get the kill on B heavy gold with another one as well Martinez will strike and H is going to take in his down the aite crumbling to Pieces as icy can only get exits and 9 Z are up to completely Flawless on the T side there something to not even in that gun round while they're pting out from Palace and Maine they also had a lker get all the way up short and lost the fight to icy so that was the tell straight away that the or was on V so as soon as they start dropping the rifl on that a bomb site they can look to go in for the exit try and make this round even more expensive try and make sure that cloud n bring nothing forward into the next they got plenty of cash for 9 Z so they could lose all their players and still be good for a buy you can see I is being pushed upon by hop Peak Martinez's or is also closing in the pinces Hop Peak moving closer AK is going to just about get caught off guard I see terrorists win think you should keep the awp here Martinez is not going to go overly aggressive although he is still putting itility down inters Corner away from spotting Max seen of his shoulder in the end everyone's going to come up with that kill information called out by his teammate h can take aile as the execution is inbound at the me bomb site the awp is heavy pressure in need to provide support right here aware of an under pass individual goes in for a kill dgt takes him back I with a quick swing and a hit and needs to escape the ey of the or martinz who takes boage back down to a two versus two H so Peak now outside of the apartment I see is lurking in waight spotting his man still missing his shots Tagg down a 34 and heavy God is coming with extra support from short now getting hasso to drop Martinez is in the one versus two this time for N9 Z to clut up moving closer to IC Tech 9 is pulled out for a close range fight 18 seconds and IC is low HP heavy got AK watching for the swing he gets caught off guard but still adjust the spr still keeps control for Cloud9 as they finally break this round streak for nine Zen and get their first of the CT side double ORS are back in play axile towards mid swinging forward doesn't see dgt who popped out the smoke the perect timing is there and a man Advantage for the tside and never won it previously on the double orb so they bring him out again heavy God struggling to choose who to fight against at least get a returning kill onto one but now that pressurization of the Beast split is presting again you've already got a player that's dropped down out of the apartment second player involved but uh not being heard Martinez comes in from short in is not accounting for that position no one defending on the CT side the light play towards the a site might get tested bua has been tagged low heavy God cannot connect the kill of the dgt and now icy is left alone boage is still looking to hunt for this individual a hasso peak May well get his AK the drop on the SMG but what more can he do both individuals are tagged on Cloud9 they're going in for the save 9 z a wonderful response the perfect moment in this match results aren't there and maybe it is cloud n dropping down to tier 2 unmotivated to continue to push team that almost certainly will struggle if this continues when the partner systems go away next year but heavy go and aile are trying to change the narrative two quick picks in heavy go towards getting martinz hasso peak's been tagged axile removes him and finally some confidence from cloud n as they get to map Point first now I'm going to change that uh that wording some confidence from heavy God every single round that Cloud9 are now going to win on the city side is going to be because of that triple kill that he had on B and now the multi frag kill that he had on Mid EGT trying to hunt for exit frags trying to take these guns out of their hands trying to limit as much as he can there will of course be B available for 9 Z but he's unable to get any of those casualties Cloud n with all five alive and two opportunities to close have we go the n in towards mid n sent smokes will cover icy will take a first shot but not connect anything meanwhile 9 Z three players total towards the a site entryways boom backed up at ninja spot heavy God trying to aggress towards this catwalk smoke spam down axile is the man to take the kill dgt catches boom completely off guard a four versus four Inu as sight can be taken rather quickly icy stands in the M put out a jungle taking Buddha with him as he drops and has so Peak leaning forward axile ready for him and doubles up in mid control three on two for Cloud9 let try struggling to even get the bomb down now you've got dgt that's trying to cover protection out here from Jungle there's no over peek from in just yet heavy God wrapping around the back line splashes forward for in will spun on that damage he's so wary of a CT WP though they're paranoid here Cloud9 but not as paranoid as dgt needs to be 1 V3 for Martinez and he doesn't hit his kill a triple from axile two wonderful Fring from mid and it's him the Difference Maker for the 1310 Cloud n barely taking their M and it was all multi frags realistically you have the triple kill that comes in in the second half from heavy God you then have the multi frag round from axile and heavy God and then the round to close is a triple from axile you want to see competitive gun rounds you want to see both teams giving it a good fight because it is an elimination game now I will say look at the score from Cloud9 1311 1311 loss versus Mongols and now 13 to 10 that in my eyes depending on how the rounds go down maybe it might be different but at least the score score should be competitive if we continue that chain logic well the score may be competitive but the two halves would not so that might be the ultimate difference between a good score and a good matchup Cloud n on the CT side start of ancient as you would expect map 2 9 Z pick early today they did of course get that 13 to4 victory over fanatic on it so you can imagine that if they do get their way then they could also find themselves in a one-sided fashion pistol set up right spotting a player out towards main not able to hit the opening shot against DT it J quickly down by Max here ax going to get left completely surrounded as Martinez takes the secondary pick as a five versus three for 9 Z an's just doing nothing there for cloud makes it very difficult for the retaking players in spawn bomb hased swinging forward for boage getting the one kill on but and immediately backing out there aware that the central sight Defenders and dgt around the big box now just being detected takes boage out alongside Max support on heavy God and in on 44 points of health will not be winning anything in this clutch pistol win for n z you have straight off contact on the big box player where USP is struggling out towards donut the Julie tries to wide swing and just gets denied straight away so always really tough to work that 3v5 for Cloud9 and what passion UA 402 on hltv gaming Gladiators in about the 60 or 70 marker Passion of the RMR but gaming Gladiators AR yeah perhaps Le one cl have overcome during Shanghai but now trying to overcome the challenge of N9 Z Max has caught axile first dgt going to take in down Max was heavily tagged up in that exchange and boich will be dealt with so quickly by hop Peak two versus five N9 Z yet to lose a player every time I see a collapse in anywhere on the bomb on on the map whether it's a bomb site whether it's mid I'm just thinking in my mind I wonder what the face cam aboit is looking like there is there a full rage is there a big tilt cuz we were seeing a lot of it out in that first map might not be able to make it out alive in This One Max Mac 10 just seeing his gun barrel heavy go has no idea being flanked at two points of he he can still take that kill IC should get found sooner or later oh just by half Peak terrorist and there it is all five alive for I dead Cloud not look scary at all trying to put some fear into the half five but uh truly favorite TI here is 9 Z in this round axile he's for a couple of kills here just dgt especially theer angles gained M4 picked up man of Cloud 9 here they've got a walk timing of hasso peak creating space to a the issue is he needs to fight against the CT and donut player Buddha can't even get this engage against ax they just keep remoking the lane entrance minute to play with has so is G access to that a bomb side there's no easy line for that bomb to rotate in boom is about to start making his way around position low HP on this exchange allowing the M4 to get that kill so rotation Avenue has opened up but where do they go with this n z do they continue towards the B site seems like they do they just need to keep prodding as long as they keep defa that's when they'll be able to create more space and catch CTS over positioning you've got a slight extension in this Don up position from Icy but Axel's caught the right timing he he's on for the Triple in the round dropped the bomb and L Quadra to reface no going to allow that player to peek out bu going to upgrade to the AK and now they start pressing onto IC position the P250 the only 100 HP element in this without Kevlar though and he's playing his cards perfectly bu and H PE both going to get seen he waits for his chance to strike and Strikes on one heavy God can clean up the last wonderfully played steal from cloud n every go came in with support aile the man the end of the last map will start off this one for Cloud9 quick in towards mid Forin as Max going to get him at unable to trade it back max so fast to the head shot low HP Hood has also been bud has also been tagged five on three established Max going to walk through the smoke we get traded pretty quickly by heavy Gods so over extensions are polished on Cloud 9 and n9z are hitting really hard with these aggressive mid Maneuvers at the moment they are just getting entry after entry and all of this cave space boom is going to come right back in and he's going to be up against two players you've got Max who is just so key on just running just kind of saying yep got a good spawn send me out as long as you've got good flashes behind me I don't me I don't mind being that front runner that's just going to go up close and personal against guys like inters and axile I spoke about the individual struggles that in was having at certain portions of Mirage he's the mid player and he's 0 and five he's just been getting owned having to bring in another comeback like N9 Z it did on on the first map they're going for another one of these a heavy contacts they've been liking this in the first half three players out ices or posted to try and receive the lane presence over on the other side of the map are being contested but not by a massive margin Martinez walks right into the kill re Bing to look towards Main and Tree Land a leg shot on Max so I's done well in that exchange axile the back of his AA he takes a fight towards Lane first dgt is down B picked up by heavy God so now two players remaining on the T side and Cloud n looking they're going to deal with this one excellent readability in that round for IC to spot the or on a straight contact and then think right okay let me just pre- aim out here towards tree to see if there's a boost up Shadow Advantage does get baited but Max and hasso Peak they've just got no chance of doing anything in this 2v5 smoke towards Temple to ensure no further aggressive presses can come through towards CT spawn heavy is going to press out of CT spawn and onto the bomb like as so PE well known about out in the open will take one player with him but needs a miracle to get the other four the bomb is not even on the bomb site itself so uh there's nothing for it even heavy god with his outrageous performances in that first map is not been as heavy when it comes to the second but this multi frag sequence has at least set up the round hopak is just hoping for a bit of exit damage cuz money still quite good on the T side try and take a couple of extra rifles away from the CTS but not to be only two dropping an exceedingly good spot given his performances on Cloud9 in recent Affairs team itself not quite the beneficiaries of that success though Martinez is or looking for Icy First Shadow being seen quick swing from the tside Ora the Spaniard planning an opening very quickly it has struggled against the man at various periods in this series Max is get caught by aile though so the tra of four versus four is good for only a moment they've looked good in mid haven't they n9z constant battle towards donut and Red Room even with the trade there from axile it's not enough to keep the numbers up and bomit is a load on beam heavy God can be fairly quick to rotate to get into the backat lines of short but this looks to be a full on exag flash is over Smokes on short boit is going to hide wait for heav go to rotate up with the M4 in hand AK with his back turn going to make this a three versus three so the round becomes a bit more doable they are continuing to challeng back going to get turned they face in h PE with the kill in from long heavy go can take H right back and the awp is also full on Triple heavy is the hand that smacks you down Cloud n take a round M what a round coming out of heavy God the Crosshair placement was on point but the moveability of the strafing from cave to w that is such a tough round to recover you are the only player on B you are still waiting from your a rotate going to Tain the tides of this map up here for cloud n thanks to his efforts two more to make up against N9 dead econom is getting broken down on the tside into Lane they look to fight heavy God and boom MIT not quite extending out towards the lane presence the smoke start coming in early N9 one a very fast execution heavy Go's good against and dgt almost as well against Buddha axile going to have to get that trade back and bomit holding Max away beyond that smoker ma 10 and an AK to clutcher 2 versus 4 I'm convinced that's the first time we've seen Cloud9 start 3B they've normally been utilizing axile and Inter in mid and then having just boage and heavy God on on this B bomb site and then the one round that 9z try and B pop they try and go aggressive it's just too many players to defend you've got heavy got it long that gets two axile that gets two boich that's trying to maintain that cheater angle for as long as possible doubtful that he's going to hold much more they are going to go hunting for him so they take this rifle out it's going to cause issues for N9 Z rebis as well oh just catching axile is back turn it ready take the shot and loses the fight let's put it this way you mentioned 1.27 and that's a Series against bongol map one Mirage got 1.55 now that set the pace inter now with 1.08 on Mirage and zero against peak in that exchange advantage of the awp that I is going have to try and Bing back EGT fragged out R has been picked up for both Max and the Martinez bond does get dropped a blind shot from IC Martinez another blind kill against goich from Beyond these smokes Z continue to fight back max is low HP has is finally going to get caught I've dropped the bomb at Temple that takes away any chance now for n zen they had such a sick opener I mean that deagle kill is just disgusting against in out in default but they just can't manage much more from that point onward Martinez doesn't have any armor so the AK with the aim punch is always going to struggle in the jewels and then just being sandwiched the double Temple and the one in donut I play with his food misses the shot actually Martinez kills him off so it's another expensive round again for cloud ning the or being lost it can get rebot for the next round Martinez is looking for more right here smokes will clear towards the temple entry WS back at CT and back at sight Max cing footsteps heard back are turn Max is going to get picked up Martinez has missed his window still aren't watching this entrance but a going to keep himself protected so as he look to take that fight they'll back away towards the bomb site knowing that time is against Martinez hold a crossfire iny doesn't get a plant out and therefore no chance to win the round itself flashes the St for more time heavy God the insurance policy hearing footsteps around him cat the man with his bomb pulled out and Cloud n surely you must be thinking press Tab and realize the inter is basically getting overrun so easily on a I'm surprised that we're not seeing more a exx in the mid to late round it seems that there's a lot of B movement more Stack Up site with the better players on it maybe that might be the undoing of n that lack of willingness to adapt pressure the one man that is the weak link here for Cloud9 bu a decent kill to start doubles up to axile as well boom Mitch is back away here is going to face in from C gets that one kill but hop Peak takes him right back it's icy and in in the two versus three and much like every man disadvantage that Cloud9 have had in this half they're opting to save their weapons N9 Z look for the 75 half once again for their favor but taged heavily Max dead to right Z out charging in towards Lane to get a kill before he drops into B two in the midf fight dgt is going to try and fight back against in the OR of iy missing his kill so that might leave in in a bit of a bad spot right here the H sent towards this corner should get him to drop and indeed it does three men remain on cloud n well they know that boom Mitch and heavy got of the B players and they know that IC is in from mid so they've got information on what the C setup is the problem is how do you initiate these kills well Martinez is trying to walk up B and he may have just been seen by heavy got it long the footsteps of the man boom oh just barely adjusted against Martinez dead to right on heavy go with the damage that boom of course did in that exchange now dgt press on IC cannot get away against the P250 as Cloud9 will make it complete evens at the turn of the half are going to end up getting completely overwhelmed much like they did for the majority of that second half of Mirage pistols in for both sides USP is Glocks Julie's in for Martinez and H Peak the first Contact in towards main going to get run down by the core three players jul is on the open position Martin is quickly caught by axile the same five on three max struggling with his USP his teammate of Bud has been gy runs out of ammo Max is dead bu on 10 points of Health DT can get one before he ends up dropping the bombs gone down towards the B bomb site so even if was able to somehow get these two kills he's not going to find any sort of retake cloud n all important pistol to their name and smokes will come down towards those lanes and dgt starts backing off they're going for the straight up rotate he has absolutely no idea they're walking in he sees the bomb carrier sees one of the forward players trying to take a fight and does win it out against boage caught jumping there in the middle of the open and very quickly the CTS wrap around these fakers need to join the two Defenders now I's got a stall for time cuz it's going to take a while for the rifl is out on B to get here got an AK in his hands into ma 10 out towards donut ready for the rotations the third player in for Mid the backstab for heavy God iy three to gain here over at Temple hasso Peak offers himself up kill gets found two more Round the Corner flashbang he put a blinded but not blinded enough heavy God can strike three versus three and all three players are tagged heavy God down near lines up a Quadra with a triple more than enough the EGT is out of there running to save the M4 and Cloud9 have nine he just looks unbelievable right now so much in B from heavy God good work from Icy on the bomb site out there in big box he was stalling for a lot of time wasn't really over facing wasn't giving too many chances back there to the temple players and if you're 9z I mean you are meant to be a tier 1.5 team you're getting a lot of chances at cologne at B boan at pro league at Rio at espo smokes up M4 wrapping flashes C is the Block it's not going to get fully count they boost up on top of tree but the flashes will catch the CT players one the third one Landing Martin completely unaffected ERS with two lineups and dgt and hasso Peak are down to one of the love performers on this T side and Martinez is out of there backing up towards spawn no vision onto the sight no chance to retake and nin have to continue consider protecting their economy cuz it's not great for them Cloud 9 to1 well congratulations to him because both me you and Allan in fact for that matter didn't even see it coming I am pretty sure I did predict n to lose o even if I didn't say it in the pregame I still did it in the graphic yeah all right cool just just back out as soon as you can bail out axile picked up first Max's going to follow up on a kill two of them in fact towards cave so this match is not quite as easily over and done with they are grouping together to try and look in against Martin here towards red he finds his shot on in so he's down I see detected in the moment's time n z indeed will take number seven no damage output in the tail end of things Cloud 9 now the last play has been seen the rest of the CT is going to just try see if they can hunt him here take the last AK out recover all those AKs as well positive signs for n in the movement forward indeed H will get his kill so one is low on B but what about the rest of the setup you've got a rotation from Buddha very defensive in short and then dgt with an incendiary who's playing out in Long Cloud9 slow things down for the execution moloto sense flashes over dgt forced into the open fully blinded easy pick Max could be a bit of a threat towards icy given the Lot close range of the awp but heavy God is a bigger threat towards the bomb site itself Max does not know where to look caught by IC in the end hop Peak is all alone a one versus five to recover the match for 9 Z to saay off elimination all five kills required here with B tside players huning down the onite has PE only a matter of time before he concedes and he concede at the second hle boage to close looking happy for the first time in this series at 13720 Cloud9 stay alive n zen are eliminated from the Thunder pick
